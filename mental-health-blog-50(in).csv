"checking in ,UID3762,""Hi guys, going through a pretty dodgy patch mental health wise, so very irritable at people, at problems, today it was at myself, I think really alot of it is my mood but I take some of the responsibility. But yeah hoping the next few months pick up because things havn't felt too pretty. I'm gonna try and keep things basic, go to bed at set times, live a more ordered life, I think the problem with my body is stress and from what I know cortisol with people with mood disorders, you have to keep it in check. I've been between work which isn't great for mental health as many people know but I've been trying to get something through a job agency that is manageable, that has been a bit tricky judging my own capabilities , anyways there are a few good opportunities so hopefully I can sort that soon. Anyways all the best to everyone"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Hi Im New,UID372,""Hi, Im UID372oxy, 37yr single, lonely female from WA, diagnosed with depression 18 months ago. I have a great job, financially stable, but like others have gone through some trauma in my time from death, to relationships etc. I suppose an accumulation of things may have led to my depression. I don't like talking about it with people I know, 1. because I'm an introvert and keep things to myself, but 2. mainly because I don't feel like my friends would understand. Yes UID1518 would be supportive and helfpul, but UID1518 wouldn't understand. I feel like only people who are experiencing similar things to me, may be able to relate and understand, which i why I am giving this forum a go. I guess the main thing i wanted to get off my chest is how I'm feeling...I feel like every day is a struggle to get out of bed, and I can't wait to get in it. How incredibly hard it is to put one foot in front of every second, of every minute of every hour of every day, let alone find the strength to place the other foot in front of the first one. I operate on autopilot everyday, zombie like, getting from A to B is a blur, Im not present in the moment, the lights are on but nobodys home. Every breath feels so painful. And every breath I try to take in feels like it never even reaches my chest when I inhale. Im afraid of the next day being the same as every other day-pointless, lonely, a waste. I just feel so lost, empty-yet heavy. When i find something-anything that makes me happy, I grab it, cherish it, nourish it, real on it and depend on it. Which ends up being to my detriment because somehow whatever made me happy-which I needed to feel validated-worth something, always seems to slip away. And I end up in this deep dark hole...."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Lost confused nowhere to turn,UID73,""I am fast spiraling into a depressive episode. I have bipolar. I am normally very stable as long as I have limited stress in my life. At present I have nothing but stress. I have medical issues that generally cause me some stress but UID1518 have now been compounded with the potability of yet another surgery. I own my own home and I have my parents living with me to UID1059 me and it also UID1059s them. My father invited my eldest brother to come live with us a few months ago. Not wanting the stress of the argument I agreed. My brother has a history of violence towards us and is also mentally unstable. He has starter doing things that he knows that trigger me and has escalated to damaging my things tv's and such and blaming it on our elderly mother. Which is not possible because she does not come into the rooms of mine. He has done this same routine many times in the past and I know it gets worse from UID3760.. I have told him he has 5 days to find himself somewhere else to live. He laughed at me like it was a joke. He is now calling agencies and people to do everything he can to stop me from kicking him out. I am so scared he is going to flip out and not leave and make everything as hard as possible and I have no idea how to fix it and so know very well I am going to spiral into either a severe depression or even worse on of my very very troubling manic episodes. I don't know who to turn to, who to go to, who can UID1059 me and how I can save myself from spiraling out of control! I'm so scared of losing it after so many years of a clean run."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Ongoing battle - checking in,UID1664,""Hi everyone, Over the past 4 months I've been going through a change in meds to try and kick depression being worse in the morning. It's been a tough road and it feels like it's not going to get any easier. Along with almost continuous depression rollercoaster emotions and mornings still being bad, my anxiety is smacking me about as well. My moods aren't very good and I've been close to the bottom of the dark hole where I fear I will end up in hospital. My memory is bad, which is humiliating at work and concentration is up and down. I haven't told my employer too much except that I'm having a tough time and my memory is affected. Other than that I really don't know what to tell them I've got a psychiatrist and psychologist that I am seeing. I'm feeling exhausted from the constant battle and roller coaster, living from moment to moment trying to keep my head above water. I guess I needed to check in UID3760 to be reminded that I'm not alone. UID1664"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Highly Sensitive People (HSP),UID786,""Are you sensitive? If so you might be in the range of a HSP. Studies show up to 15-30% of people could fall into this category. And I thought I was alone! Have you had the comments ”you should toughen up” ”don’t be so sensitive” Yet these people don’t realise that your sensitivity is part of you, your personality. It’s like you suggesting UID1518 grow shorter as “you are too tall” How absurd. Sensitive people have strong inner feelings, can be creative in things like writing, like to UID1059 other people or animals and generally care deeply in their convictions. So people that criticise us are in effect bullying us to be someone we are not. If possible stand up for yourself because sure as yabbies bite your toes, if you don’t then you’ll be walked over. We cant all be without sensitivity, we can’t all be low in emotion... not everyone is a highly sensitive person, if UID1518 were UID1518’d understand how our world is full of inner feelings and also wonderful in a strange way because we “feel” and that my friend is priceless...

"Anger and Irritablity and Self Service Checkouts,UID3762,""Kinda funny kinda not but today got a display of my low frustration tolerance, ha I find those self service machines at the supermarket a pain, I seem to put my shopping in the wrong area and then someones gotta come over and fix it, but i was thinking these have annoyed me for a while but I gotta learn to slow down and learn the process its probably the supermarket UID1195 aswell not always great for people with anxiety at times. Anyone else share this grievance haha ? I''ll be practising my mindfullness with the machines or just using the old style checkout."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"My story (Any advice would be appreciated),UID372,""Hi all, I’m new UID3760, nice to UID3584t everyone. I figured I’d come UID3760 to lay out my thoughts and story as my anxiety and depression has been plaguing me for years and in the past two years, it has affected a lot quite directly. I don’t even know where to start because there’s a lot but I’ll do the best I can. Basically, one of the main factors of this is I’m 31 - for pretty much all of my twenties, I’ve avoided committing to long term relationships for having been hurt in the past and through fear of not being good enough for someone. For a number of factors. I’ve always generally had some kind of anxiety - I’m very much an introverted extrovert. I have a lot of friends but I’m still somewhat quiet and different from some of my peers and especially my immediate family. Although, I feel like I seem to have inherited anxiety from my parents - my Mum is not the most confident and my Dad is UID1183 and just not the same kind of person since having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 18 years ago. There’s things I hate about myself - I’m 31 and I don’t have a full driving license which some people think is weird/pathetic. A bit of a trivial thing but it matters to me. I’m actually so afraid of not doing something correctly on the road that I’ve had panic attacks on the road during tests and lessons and have spent so much money on this only to fail over and over again. I’m not from a lucrative background - for lack of a better term, my family are quite poor and for a while I was basically the breadwinner as I was the only one in the family with a job. Hence once of the reasons why I still can’t drive because I could never afford it until later in life (which doesn’t matter anyway as I keep failing)."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"checking in as in a tired space,UID3762,""Think my medication is only doing a quarter of what its supposed to now , will see psychiatrist tommorow, ah the brain is great when its well hah but when its not.

"Struggling with Depression and constant disappointment,UID372,""I have struggled with depression for the past 2 years now and am still bouncing between different medications as I feel it either isn’t UID1059ing or I get side effects which just makes everything feel worse. I am really struggling lately because I feel there aren’t many options left and my Psychiatrist just doesn’t seem interested, she is always busy and her office takes me an hour to get to. I want to see someone else closer to where I live and who I feel comfortable talking to but I just can’t take that step to tell her or UID3584t a new person and have to start all over again. It just seems like so much effort and I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I have no enjoyment in my life, as soon as I get home from work I just want to sleep. I tried joining a sports team to be active and UID3584t new people but it didn’t last very long, the tiredness eventually won and I started cancelling on training's and games. I just honestly don’t understand why I am UID1183, my life is good. My family don’t understand it either, UID1518 try to be useful but just end up saying the wrong thing and then I stew on that as it goes around and around in my head twisting into something that may have started out as “meaning well”. I am the person who jokes and makes a group laugh but it’s all just a mask, and it is so draining, I can’t keep it up as long as I used to anymore I think that’s why I don’t have friends to talk to about anything anymore, I try to catch up with them but I always get cancelled so my “friend” group has considerably lessened in the past year. Everyone seems to tell me all there problems even if I don’t know them very well, apparently I’m a caring considerate person and people feel comfortable telling me things. I listen and give advice where I can and UID1518 seem to walk away happier, Its strange because I find it so hard to talk to people about feelings and emotions, it’s just not something I was taught to do growing up and I just get so uncomfortable and awkward when asked about myself, I just don’t make sense when I try to explain something. It makes me feel stupid like a complete idiot. So to sum everything up I think I’m exhausted trying to keep the smiling face up in front of everyone while being constantly disappointed by everything happening in my life. I don't see myself ever being happy again."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Am I depressed or just lazy?,UID372,""Hi there, I am 20 years old and have spent most of this year battling with myself about whether I am UID1183 or just lazy. I severely lack motivation and on most days I don’t do anything productive or I procrastinate things until it’s almost too late. Fortunately I was able to see a psychologist until August and my GP prescribed me antidepressant medication which I have been taking for about 5 weeks now. My GP expects it be having some kind of effect by now, however I’m only noticing side effects which include a very low libido and fatigue. I’m also feeling as though it’s levelling out my emotions to a point where I don’t really feel anything, or at best a little spike that disappears soon after. Lately I have felt incredibly tired and sometimes take a nap only a couple hours after I get up. I get about 7-9 hours of sleep a night and yet I don’t feel refreshed and often awaken feeling anxious. Very recently my bedroom was renovated and I’ve spent the last couple of weeks cleaning furniture and moving things back in. For a few days I felt great and was very motivated to do things, however now I’m really struggling to find that motivation again. This is where I can’t figure out if I’m just lazy and desperately trying to use depression as a justification or if I’m actually UID1183. I’m aware I’m on antidepressants for a reason yet I have never been told “you are diagnosed with depression”, which makes me question myself. I feel like I’m wasting my youth away but I can’t seem to pull myself out of this routine. To be perfectly honest, I am most comfortable when I am doing nothing, and that makes me feel free yet very guilty at the same time. Part of me doesn’t even want to change my lifestyle. I am so torn. I don’t have access to a psychologist until February so any kind of advice would be very much appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to read. :)"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Pregnant and worried about the future ,UID372,""Sorry if this is hard to understand... I’m 22 weeks pregnant and recently some problems have been coming up involving my relationship, work and the future. I’ve just gone into my 20s and my partner and I have a 12 year age gap. He works 5 to 6 days a week whereas I’m only a casual and work very short shifts about 2 to 4 times a week. He is getting very stressed about being broke especially when baby comes. We have only been together just over a year and I had doubts coming into this relationship because I knew we were at very different stages in our lives. Although he was still living with his parents he had it set that he wanted to get married, have a family and buy his own house. I was 19 when we met and not doing very well in life, not having finished school and I had unaddressed issues with depression and was also developing anxiety. These were the reasons for my doubts, I worried I couldn’t pull myself out of it and build the lifestyle and career that I would need to UID1059 him get where he wanted to be in life. We’ve come along way since then and are renting our own house as well as having a baby on the way. Anyway, I’ve been going in and out of depression since being pregnant. I really want to have this baby, I had an early miscarriage a few months before becoming pregnant again, so I’m very happy about this pregnancy however I’m struggling to find motivation in all other aspects of my life. I’m finding it increasingly hard to enjoy work as I didn’t particularly like my job before. This is making me want to avoid it even more Because of the way it makes me feel. This is now causing problems in my relationship and I feel like I’m making my partner unhappy especially since he has problems with depression as well. We come from very different families and upbringings, I have a family history of alcoholics, addicts and mental health problems. I’m worried that my partner thinks I will end up the same, I don’t feel like I’m good enough to fit into his life and family. He says he loves me but I’m worried that will change if I can’t be happier and find some motivation. I’m worried that I’ll never be able to be the person he wanted. I don’t understand why is so hard for me to just get up and do the things I need to and why the more I think about it the more I just want to curl up and not talk to anyone. I want to be the kind of person who is happy and motivated to work hard. I don’t want this to ruin my relationship. I need some advice, I don’t know what to do."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Does anyone else feel the same? ,UID372,""I’m not sure what the feeling is but I’ve felt strange for over 7 years. I go through waves of feeling great to being extremely down to the point that arguments take over my emotion and make me feel so low to the point life is not worth feeling these emotions anymore. Because it comes in such waves and isn’t consistent, I’ve struggled to seek UID1059 with this because quickly I can feel fine and I think it must be a ‘blip’.

"New and Seeking Advice,UID372,""I’m not diagnosed with anything or on any medication. Hi, for the last few years I’ve suffered only what I can describe as depressive episodes, and other emotional mood swings. There seems to be very little that prompts these, as I can be with friends and enjoying myself one moment and then the next suicidal, I’m aware the whole time that nothing is wrong or should be but I am reduced to near tears. I rarely act on these impulses, and there’s enough of a period between them where I question if there’s anything actually wrong. Mostly I am also struck by a great deal of lethargy and try to stay asleep as long as I can, and a lot of the things I once enjoyed no longer hold any interest to me. It feels like the luster has gone out of life and I’m only existing out of obligation. Though, I do not feel I am in any immediate danger to myself, I have made attempts in the past and it is a daily thought or consideration, and I find thoughts such as “kill yourself”, “go die” come unprompted and even to the point I sometimes verbalise them without thinking. I will be taking steps to see a GP and work on my mental health plan, it's just all a little confusing and I feel lost in it."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Bipolar 2 - Recent diagnosis,UID372,""Hi all I have recently had a diagnosis of with Bipolar 2. It is as if everything in my life to date makes complete and perfect sense. I grew up in an extremely abusive household. That aside my memories of certain situations and things I have done are now making sense. I have been on and off anti-depressants for a very long time. They always worked fast and stop working after a few years. I have seen counselors and psychologists and finally gave up and went to see a psychiatrist. After a thorough and detailed history she said I think 'you have bipolar 2'. Her explanations and discussion explained me exactly. More UID1183 than happy. Go for days feeling pretty crappy functioning and feeling so low and then out of nowhere I am happy. When I am happy I am stupid happy-over confident, can do anything, joking, singing, multi task off the charts, mind racing, chatty, obsessed with sexual thoughts but risky sex, the best way to explain it is that I feel 'high and floaty'. As suddenly as it comes it goes and I'm back to mopey. sad and thinking that everyone hates me. This has gone on forever. And got worse as I have gotten older. So now I am taking new medication at night to assist in a stabilizing my mood and and anti-depressent for anxiety/depression during the day. I feel relieved and even more so the nutcase. I have always felt alone and on the outside of what others call 'life' - friends, parties, travel cars, excitement etc. I am intolerant of superficial things and I can go from pretty okay to angry, angry in a flash. I hate anything that I perceive as unfair. I feel like an emo fairy. I feel like I have no tribe. I hate it and everyday it feels like I have to rebuild myself and put myself back together again. How do I make and keep friends? How do I trust after a childhood of severe abandonment?

"Relying on others for happiness,UID372,""I recently confided in a friend that I feel very lonely and UID1183 because I have so little social contact with any of my friends anymore. I am now in my fourth year of uni and each year has been more difficult because friends don't have as much free time. I spent a lot of Fridays and Saturdays working over the last three years and couldn't go out but no one is free to do anything anymore now that I'm more freed up. My social life is one-way texts (me texting friends and not getting anything back) and brief coffees every few months that I have to work hard to arrange. I also feel bad because the only time my friends usually reach out to me is when UID1518 need UID1059 with assessment. I know UID1518 aren't trying to hurt my feelings but it's very bad for your self-worth when people only contact you unexpectedly when UID1518 need to improve their grades. My birthday is also coming up in two weeks and I don't want to plan anything because I can't deal with being turned down by people anymore. With so many knockbacks when I try to have fun, I've resorted to doing heaps of things on my own. Some of these things have been good but I still feel really lonely and UID1183. When I told my friend all of this, she said I shouldn't rely on other people for my happiness. It's not that she wasn't otherwise supportive, I just feel out of ideas since I need to be social to be happy. After months of going alone, I need more social time with my friends but that seems impossible. And given my struggles right now, that's all I need. Making new friends at 22 is confronting, terrifying and humiliating. Any advice is welcome. I am still friends with that friend but I was a bit taken aback by her advice not to rely on people when I was just saying I need more contact."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"What strategies or things do you employ during your bipolar episodes -  both manic and depressive,UID2020,""Hi everyone, Today I'm struggling to find something to pre-occupy me. Legally I'm supposed to have a carer watch over me due to my strong medications. I have a lot of interests but today it feels like one of those days where you start something and then move on and do something else. When I'm manic (based on memory) Based on depression: Strategies: Manic: art, music (567 songs and still counting), comics, knitting, cleaning (UID1263y person) but I really did tidy up the house in just a few days my SO was shocked... usually when I clean I make a mess , walk the dog if i can stay calm Depressed: I do as above but i dont feel like doing it. I don't have any motivation or energy. I wake up in a house that's empty. Well I'm also UID3760 on forums wanting to find someone or people who can relate to this. There are days where I question who I am, is it me or not me and question whether I said the wrong thing? This is my first time being alone on recovery. So I've been in psych wards twice.

"Triggers- what are your distractions for recovery?,UID786,""Do you suffer from triggers? What is a trigger? For me, a trigger is a moment that panic can set in quickly. From that moment on it is a battle to overcome the fallout. Often a panic attack will accompany the shaking, the stress and for me anyhow- the overwhelming temptation to- cry. Today it happened. My wife and I went for a drive for coffee. Lovely UID1978 winters day arrived at our favourite country general store café at a very small town only to see the """"closed"""" sign. Ok, we'll go to a country house nearby where UID1518 advertise Devonshire tea. As we pulled up the thought came to me about cash. The other place took eftpos which is what we use all the time. This little place isn't likely to take cards. As the old lady approached I didn't have time to talk about it to my wife...in fact the old lay was impossible to interrupt so I could speak about the matter. On and on she talked as we walked about 50 metres to the """"tea rooms"""" all the while not able to talk. As we arrived at the rotunda I had to interrupt but the shakes started and I was desperate with wanting to ask my wife if she had any real money. So out it came """"do you take eftpos"""" I asked. At that exact moment an old man called out to the old lady something about taking his dogs to a friends place. She walked towards him out of sight. So I didn't get my answer. This freaked me out more in frustration. I turned to my wife and asked her """"I hope you have cash""""? """"Oh, she thought, """"I don't think so"""". I had to return to the car where I found $8 in coins then returned and my wife found $5 in her purse. The old lady returned and we asked the cost of Devonshire tea and she replied """"$16""""- we were short $3. She was ok with that and being locals we'd make up for it when seeing her in town. The event shook me up. The rotunda and nearby sheds had jugs as a display many of them so it was a distraction. About 20 minutes later I was 90% recovered. The overwhelming desire is to cry but being older and male it doesn't come. Distraction is my tool for recovery. I don't think there is a better or faster remedy. Do you know of any? Prevention is better than cure and having $50 or so on you is the preventative measure. We'll try and do that of course. UID3981l free to contribute.

"Has anyone experienced Hypomania? I've experienced it twice and have questions about it.,UID2020,""Hi my name is J, In the last two years - I have had two hypomanic episodes where I could still somewhat function as normal: my symptoms were not obvious . I feel that these are worse than when I was in full episodes yet I cant remember a lot, which is probably why. Going through this episode, not being put in hospital, and coping with being alone during the day makes me feel lonely but i choose not to have any trains of thoughts but by being pre-occupied with something. I'm a high maintenance/ require a lot of things to do to burn off at the beginning - but now i feel flat and on the UID1183 side which is usually me. SO My questions are: Have you had a hypomanic episode? How did you know/feel/think you were having one? Were your symptoms obvious or not obvious?

I have had the mood disorder bipolar disorder since 2011. So far I have had 4 different types of episodes - so it makes my life and my carer's life a little more challenging to identify symptoms of bipolar. I rarely tell people I have bipolar - the stigma is still there, even though the psychiatrist says I'm an elevated person - I'm rather UID1183 and pessimistic. People treat me differently when I say bipolar yet if I said depression or anxiety it appears to be an accepted thing. I've gone through a lot in 2018 for my 2nd last episode - ask If you want to - and to this day it still affects m - I think during that period of my time I literally became a broken person.

I don’t want to disappoint my family for wanting to take a break this semester...

"teenage friendship drama pls help me,UID372,""So I'm 17 years old in my last year of high school and I honestly just want it to be over. Throughout my whole schooling life, I've always looked forward to this year, thinking it would be the best year of my life. Needless to say, I am very underwhelmed with the experience. So last week I discovered that my best friends had made a group chat without me and were using it to talk badly about me behind my back. I had noticed that something was wrong because UID1518 had started acting distant, ignoring me, finding excuses to not be around me etc. I considered the idea that UID1518 maybe UID1518 had made the group chat but brushed it off, thinking that it was all in my head and I was just reading into it. But I was at a party one night and I saw the group chat on each of their phones, I saw one of my friends opening the chat and it was just the four of them in the chat, so I know it wasn't for another reason. They realised that I had found out about the group chat and didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the night, although UID1518 never really talked to me in the first place. The day after I message them about it, explaining that I was really upset and asking if UID1518 could at least tell me what I had done to hurt them. None of them could really give me a straight answer but it had something to do with them thinking I was mean. (for context, my friends and I had this thing where we all would jokingly insult each other, it was never ill-intend and was all out of love). I didn't really understand because we were all mean to each other it was kind of our thing. Since then, UID1518 have apologised for making the chat and we are kind of back on good terms. But recently UID1518 all went to someones party that I wasn't invited to (the guy doesn't like me, I thought we were friends but oh well). At school UID1518 keep talking about the party and pulling people aside so UID1518 can talk in private. It feels like UID1518're going out of their way to leave me out and it's making me worry that maybe the group chat has started up again. I have major anxiety about what people think about me so this is kind of freaking me out. I'm not the most popular person and these are the only friends I have, so I don't have anyone to talk to about this. Hopefully this UID1059s :)"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Massively struggling right now,UID372,I am a teacher who is dealing with anxiety and depression from starting a new job a term ago. I came in with little handover at a busy time of the year. Each week something new is brought up which I am expected to learn. I have told my line manager that I am struggling and not sure where to prioritise my time and it has lead to little support. I feel worthless in my role and I am not having any joy for teaching anymore. I have been teaching for 10 years and this is the first time I have felt like this and it is worrying. I struggle to get up in the morning and spend most of my nights planning and trying to solve my issues with zero success. Each day is a stuggle to get through. I am seeing a councillor and have taken many mental health days where I have seen my doctor and he is at the point of prescribing anti depressants. Today I had a UID3584ting with my line manager and principal with the sole intention of expressing my thoughts and feelings and desire to give my two week notice. As predicted UID1518 tried to keep me by saying everything I have been doing is great and I am a valued member. Sadly I caved in my decision which has made me feel worse that I have put their needs and the school needs ahead of my own mental health. The I am the second teacher already for the class this year as the first one left on maternity and I can understand UID1518 don't want to have to go through it again but I shouldn't worry about that as much as i should. I hate confrontation and fear I will always give in to what someone else wants instead of looking out for myself. They don't see how much I struggle at home and alone in the classroom. I know I am not doing the best job I can as I have lost that passion. I fear how dark some of my thoughts are getting. I wish for a reason to not go in like a sporting injury or someone hits my car. Nothing I am responsible for but it saves me from having to face my issues. I don't know what the answer is and almost need someone to be there and push me into it so I don't back out.,depression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Obesity and mental anguish,UID786,""Your GP tells you that your Body Mass Index calculation puts you in the obese range.

The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres"""".

"How do you cope day-to-day when it gets tough?,UID372,""I’ve had depression for about 10 years. It very much comes in cycles for me. Sometimes I will be travelling pretty well and then it creeps back in. I often avoid it and don’t do much to UID1059 myself until it gets really bad and I end up being self-destructive. I don’t really have much family/friend support but I’ve always seen GPs/Pscyhologists/Psychiatrists. However, I’ve recently moved towns and haven’t yet connected with any health services. I feel like I just go through cycles of counselling (which costs so much money) and I don’t really pick up any new strategies that actually make a difference/that I genuinely want to use. I stress about how much it costs when I don’t feel like UID1518 have given me any useful strategies (although I do feel better talking to them). UID372ight now, I’m struggling to get through the day. I work in a job that is very people-oriented and requires me to be pretty aware and on-my-game. At the moment, I’m so anxious about completing daily tasks that I just can’t even start them. When I’m at work, my mind feels fuzzy and I struggle to communicate with people (which is the main part of my job). I just don’t want to be around anyone. I kind of want to push through my symptoms of depression and anxiety because in the past I’ve given in and given up completely. I’ve quit many jobs and broken down at many different workplaces from getting to this point. I feel like I’m at breaking point in this job now too. I’m worried if I keep doing what I’m doing, I’ll break down at work and end up quitting in a moment of desperation. If I did leave, I don’t want it to be like that. Also, it’s extremely difficult to get more than a day or two off work so I cant take any extended time off or anything to just reset (I don’t think time off would UID1059 me at all as this intensifies my anxiety). Do I take UID3800 off? Do I just keep pushing past the symptoms and try to not fall apart at work? Do I quit this job and try and find something less stressful, where I can have more flexibility to manage my mental health? Does anyone have any strategies to stop yourself just completely falling apart when you just have to go to work/look after kids/etc? Do you just push through to get things done?

I spiraled after a event involving someone who I thought was a real friend. And I realised after that I have no friends. I was so miserable that I did something I never did before, I told everyone I was struggling and sought them out (as friends are supposed to be there for you right? I guess not if you were never their real friends to begin with it seems) ... and UID1518 all disappeared (some straight away, others took a month or two) ... until I was literally alone. This broke my heart. And I don't know what to do. I often walk by the man who made me realise this. Before my misery drove everyone away he was like my best friend. We'd catch up every week ... it was awkward catchups because we are both awkward people, but that's why I liked him so much. It was like we are both the same kind of outsider (but unlike me everyone seems to love him) ... but now he pretends he doesn't' see me when our paths cross. I saw him just UID1861, and he literally looked up at me, his face turned dark and than he looked away. I realise that this is my fault. I freaked him right out with my misery, when I realised I alienated him my last words to him was that I'd never bother him again but if he wanted to catch up I'm always UID3760. That was probably 18 months ago. Occasionally he'll wave from a afar if he sees me, but mostly he pretends he doesn't see me. And this is devastating. He was my last friend on this crappy world. I've tried to move on. Make new friends, a new canvas. I have pretty bad social anxiety too, so anything to do with people is hard, but I try and it's the same old story. The best I can hope for is people humouring me ... I feel like one those chronically unlikable ladies who goes around talking to strangers cause nobody else will.

After almost 8 years of battling my worsening mental state, I’ve finally found the courage to tell some of my friends but I’m not ready to tell them the full extent of it because I don’t want them to have to carry this darkness in their lives too. I used to feel invincible: in my dream degree (medicine), successful athletically, and capable of talking to anybody about anything, and more importantly willing and able to UID1059 anyone I cared about with anything.

But after the person I considered my only true friend, and the person I wanted to spend my life with - chose a path of actions that made me experience hurt more than I’ve ever experienced in my life, something in my brain snapped and it’s felt like I’ve been cut off from the ability to use it properly ever since. It wasn’t a gradual creep, it was like a switch. I dropped out of medicine to do Commerce, since it was less rigorous and I could attempt to balance my shifting moods with my workload. My whole personality changed, my new insecurities would flare up at any little trigger and my ordinarily sharp memory has deteriorated to the point I can’t hold a conversation or recall recent events. Although somewhat ironically, I constantly wake up at 3am on work nights to nightmares of events that have upset me and am unable to get back to sleep. I’ve intermittently sought professional UID1059, tried all sorts of self medicating, meditation etc. but nothing’s UID1059ed me so far. It think the saddest thing is I have no longer have any will to live. I’d never act on this, I don’t have the strength, and I care too much about my family and friends.

"I have no energy to do anything ,UID372,""Hi everyone, In April 2018 I was diagnosed with Major depression, Social anxiety and an adjustment disorder. UID794 in my family ever spoke about mental health so I never really thought about it before all this happened and now I just feel broken, pathetic and weak. I’m having a tough time at the moment, the past 10 months have been the hardest time in my life it’s full of ups and downs and I think I’m just about ready to crack. Just trying to get out of bed each day and find the enthusiasm to do anything anymore is so difficult. I've been on line a lot reading about how people have been in the same situation and what UID1518 have done to UID1059 them and I just don’t understand these people. Speaking to friends, doing exercise, eating healthy, talking to a psychiatrist. But I don’t understand how people can just do any of that! I have no energy to exercise, I don’t trust anyone to talk to them and I don’t have the energy to do groceries so when I can be bothered to eat then it’s gonna be junk food. Im always tired and all I think about at work is getting home and crawling back into bed, I used to put so much passion into my work and really make changes now I couldn’t care less. The only reason I turn up and do the bare minimum is because if I lose this job I also lose my house, and access to health professionals. I am a burden on those I work with and I hate that it’s come to this but I really just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t think this job is for me but if I leave I lose everything. I was taken off antidepressants and sleeping tablets in October 2018 because apparently I’m doing well but nothing has changed, even on the medication I didn’t feel any better. I feel like the Dr’s just don’t want to deal with me. I know things have to change, I just can’t do it and it makes me feel even worse, I wish I could wake up UID3800 being totally happy with everything and not have a care in the world but thats never going to happen. I don’t even know why I’m typing this, it’s not like I have a question I guess I just wanted to share my story with people that would listen and hopefully not judge me. I guess any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. UID372egards, UID372."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Worthlessness off the charts,UID372,""UID3114 why I'm even writing this UID3760 but, I guess I'm looking for UID1059, something positive, anything really. I am seriously at the end of my tether. 2018 started out so fantastic and I was super grateful for everything coming my way in my business and in general. Then something happened. I started drinking again, was completely off it in January/Feb which was great, it does me no favours. Then the months rolled on up till now. My business is dying with a lack of clients, good clients and I feel like I have made all the mistakes a person can. It has cost me dearly. I can't even pay myself a wage and contribute to the home right now. My Wife is working and she covers it all. I know she's not happy about it at all and fair enough. The last 2-3 months have almost killed me. We tried to get finance to buy a new place and move, it took that long because UID1518 stuffed up! At the last minute despite being told it was all ok, UID1518 declined it. It all fell back on me and my inability to have good money coming in. We lose out because of me not having all this and miss out on doing good things. I know my Wife is pissed off about it all, let down because of me. I feel so worthless, unwanted and unloved (with the exception of my little girl). UID3981l like my Wife regrets getting involved with me, she's not interested in me right now because of all this. I have nothing, no assets, zip. I'm not lazy and I do work hard to do well but, obviously, I don't have what it takes, should have stayed an employee. It is my fault that it all happened. She wants me to get a job which is fair enough. It depresses me so much that it's come to this, I've failed, ruined a lot of things, it's very embarrassing. I have no one to talk to about it, get UID1059 from, advice, ideas, nothing. UID3981l like my Wife doesn't want to hear it, we can't even have a friendly conversation about it. I am trying to do things, get a job and manage things in the background. It's a bad time of year for it though. I am stuck in concrete and can't move, think clearly. If I didn't wake up tomorrow, I'd be ok with that, except my little girl would be devastated. I have nothing and no one right now and it really sucks. UID3981l like we should get divorced so she can get on with it and not have me around dragging her down. Sorry if I'm ranting UID3760, just really stuck.

"Over analysing, over thinking,UID786,""I'm happy to claim my depression has taken a holiday. Well I forced it to, it had no choice. Sometimes things in life need a heavy hand or out witting them. Coming up with strategies might need your own ideas as our depression is very individual. There can be some similarities however- let's explore some. If you over think issues, possibilities then you might have too much free time on your hands. When I have a project (like building our caravan) that takes calculations and focus...I'm rarely dwelling on family issues or the local narcissist person in town. Distraction does work, seriously work! I used to have a large jigsaw in a spare room. Each time I dwelled on a toxic family member I'd retreat and do a dozen pieces. It worked. The saying """"get a life"""" can be interpreted in a nasty way but as with all things in life I focus on the facts and benefits...get a life is sort of true...a sport, a hobby, a second job..its the best way to minimalise the effects some people have on us, so we can move forward from mayhem. Another saying - """"dont sweat the small stuff"""". CEO's or owners of large companies leave the small stuff to people down the line. Federal politicians dont involve themselves with planning permits for houses, that's done by local Govt. Hence work towards filtering issues in your life to find peace away from small issues. Eg inlaws. My first marriage resulted in a few toxic inlaws that, for no clear motive, caused havic in the family. I decided, after several attempts to offer peace that """"I married my wife, not her family"""". This new attitude resulted in my peace of mind. Those few inlaws no longer have the """"feed"""" UID1518 needed to continue with undue criticism. As time went by UID1518 had no issues to satisfy their jealousy (which was the real issue). There is a significant percentage of narcissistic people in our world. I'd guess around 10-20%. That's a lot. You have little choice but to withdraw and minimalise your head space of them. These actions and distractions away from negative influences might result in some level of isolation. It will feel that you are building a wall of safety...well that's exactly what it is. And only allow the qualified to enter. That's your right. There is no obligation to entertain the nasty, just love the caring...

He used his 4wd and my legs to break the tyre of car I was working on from the rim of wheel. My wife was at home cleaning up the house for sale as we'd purchased a new one up bush. A good way to escape the '89 interest rate of 23%. Wife had to drive 50km to visit me after busting gut working while pregnant and looking after two toddlers. This made me particularly popular and began to appear to her like I was away on holidays while she did all the work. A couple of my mates and me in plaster up to the groin took our worldly possessions to the new place, wife and kids moved up while I went back on holiday in rehab hospital.

"Working for change,UID3793,""Hi all, I'm new to BeyondBlue and the whole concept of forums and threads, but need some UID1059 to make positive change. My depression, and unwillingness to act on, or face consequences of my actions/inactions has broken down my relationship with the most amazing and supportive woman whom I love so much. I'm not the person she met and fell in love with 10 years ago. I've changed, I'm not sure if this is my UID1195, depression sneaking in or what. I have mild to moderate depression, and am also identifying other behaviours I'd like to kick. I have made so many plans and promises to her that I just don't come through with, sometimes it's just too hard, or I had the idea now it's her turn to make it happen.

Approval seeking, is a behaviour I noticed recently when I started working in a new place, doing the same job i've done for years.

"The system is the source. ,UID372,""You're all warriors in my eyes and excuse me if this rant seems cynical. I have no solutions, i just want to share. There are a few mantra's in the status quo you might all be familiar with such as """"Fake it till you make it"""" or """"Human's are gregarious by nature"""" the first one is easy to refute as complete horse dung but the second isn't quiet so simple. Lets start with Fake it till you make it shall we, so you want that new job, you dress well, you boost your resume, you say the right things during the interview in order to give away the right impression, it could be the complete opposite of who you are as a person but in order to land that job you must play the game. You're encouraged to be someone you're not right from the start. It all makes sense really after all we do have an entire industry based on deception, emotional manipulation called acting and these people are payed very well to lure you into a place of living vicariously through the eyes of another person, movies. Blindly following celebrity culture and actually emulating what these people do on the screen in our own real lives, kind of morbidly twisted. This Keynesian model only has one thing on it's mind. Increase GDP, pay no mind to anything else. Then we have the notion that humans are by nature gregarious, oh really? It's statistically an improbability for this to be true. I can honestly say that I'm more calm and more myself when as far away from people as humanly possible. It may seem a little misanthropic but it's true, I'm an introverted lone wolf who does not seem to enjoy the company of others, yet UID3760 i am posting and trying to """"reach out"""", but it's more in protest rather than looking for some form of companionship. I look at what we are today, we wake up, fake up, we lie, we cheat, we're opportunistic, some play the game rather well actually, i call them covert chameleons and others just sit back and say """"hang on something is not right UID3760"""" is this the best we could do? Nations, UID372eligious fables, Keynesian economics focused on consumption and spending rather than efficiency and value! Sure It has made us a more advanced people, but on aggregate worse people. I'm not some anti-capitalism thumper since it has done amazing things for our quality of life, but it does seem that today more than ever the things you own, end up owning you.

I hate it when he shouts but then he says its my fault and never takes responsibility for his actions. He makes me believe I am mental which I think he is right and I am.

I don’t want to watch tv, sleep, eat, speak or do anything and just find myself staring at the wall or floor for hours. I just don’t really know what to do, does anyone have any advice? I think I should have some counselling but its so expensive UID3760 I think and because I am not a permanent resident I don’t think I can get it. Any support is appreciated"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"What is the point?,UID372,""Hi, im recently new UID3760, i have joined to ask for advice from a different point of view and support people that are also struggling any way i can. I have struggled with depression a long time now and its recently been getting worse i have been asking myself what is the point of living anymore, whats the point of getting out of bed, i have skipped appointments, meals just daily things cause i dont see a point of anything anymore. I am confused and been struggling with my identity as a person and in the society we now live in. I tried working and thought i was doing fine for a while but after a couple of months i started getting really down to the point i was admitted in hospital. Every time i went to work it felt like i was being put in a bind, being pulled down, suffocating looking around every corner for a exit to breathe and be free , i wanted to stop freaking out and stop making so many mistakes, to be calm to not dread the next awaiting day again and again, to the point i stopped going to work and quit. I tried to work at other places but also felt the same pain over and over again. I have stopped trying to be in relationships because i have a feeling no one will love me until i love myself which to be honest i never have in my entire life. I hate myself so much i feel useless and worthless and cant understand how people get up in the mornings now or gets up at all. I dont see the point of working, eating, or living but i still try cause i know i still have loved ones around me and care for me so i do not give up entirely because of them, i may have given up on myself but UID1518 have not given up on me so i will continue fighting even if i live a depressing life its good enough to me to be there for them in return for what UID1518 done for me. Im lost and cant see much ahead of me right now, all i can see is tears, so UID3760 i am reaching out.... please UID1059 me"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"So close to giving up,UID372,""Hi, for about 5-6 years I've been suffering from anxiety and depression (which has been caused by several events during my life), and have recently started seeing a counsellor about it. However I dont receive constant or immediate assistance. Over the last few weeks I feel like I haven't been normal and haven't been doing things I used to. I recently came back from Europe from a study tour and since then I haven't been the same. During the study tour I went through some periods where I felt like I was being bullied, I had some people who studied with me that had called me names and basically cornered me. Also recently, I was once again rejected by a 'close friend' who I have had on and off feelings for since he claims to never feel the same (there's more to that story). But overall I have been going through 'lapses' of depression (like even 2-3 in a day) and I end up spending the entire day in bed with no motivation to do anything. Everyday I feel more lonelier and lonelier, and it's coming to the point where I dont really feel like I have anyone to talk to. So that's why I made the initiative to post UID3760. I just need some support and advice to UID1059 myself out of this mess. Thanks a lot."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Why am I like this? ,UID372,""My bf has gone away back to Ireland for a holiday and I am left UID3760 in Australia in our little apartment by myself. I don’t have many friends UID3760 as many have moved back to Ireland, so I am feeling so alone. I have felt myself slowly sinking back into a dark place like I used to. I have suffered with depression before and had to be signed off work in the past as it got really bad. I have had a pretty good couple of years with only a few little episodes where it gets bad for a couple of weeks. I just feel trapped inside my own head. It’s a viscous UID2106rcle where I don’t want to speak to or see anyone because I feel so down but then because I isolate myself it gets even worse. I know its starting again. I can’t sleep at nights and I’m exhausted but never want to leave my bed. I don’t want to do anything and can’t even watch TV all I am doing is thinking. I am taking my mood out on my bf, being insecure, snappy, nasty and pushing him away. I am jealous that he is enjoying himself at home with his friends and family whilst I am UID3760 by myself in this dark place. I feel so embarrassed that I am like this and I feel that I can’t talk to anyone about it not even my bf. I am paranoid too and so anxious that he won’t come home, or he will fall in love with someone else etc. God, I sound so crazy. Will I ever get better and how? I just feel like the worst type of person and I don’t deserve love or friends."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I need people IN PERSON.,UID372,""Okay, so I've been doing pretty well this year, haven't had any serious relapses. However, I am doing the HSC this year and am falling back into my depressive episodes. Aside from that, I think I get what I'm supposed to be doing right? But whenever I'm on a forum UID3760, or anywhere online for that matter, people are always wanting someone to talk to. As am I. But the problem is, for me its just so hard to really appreciate or gain anything from this when its not even in person. I really like hugs. Like really, really. I like fluffy people because I can tell UID1518 give great hugs. But no matter how little I care for societal perceptions and expectations";" it just wouldn't be right if I hugged someone else's mum (especially if I don't know those people). Which was irrelevant information, sorry. But what I'm saying is, it would be so nice, if I could find people to sit with and talk with and maybe make some friends. It seems like there's not many opportunities for that anywhere around UID3760 - which sucks. And I honestly feel like I want to make a family out of people that are friends, but I don't have any friends to begin with which is difficult. And I've been putting the whole thing off because HSC and Uni apps are so much to think about...idk. I guess I just don't think that making friends with people is going to happen anytime soon."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"My antidepressants don't seem to be working for me anymore ,UID372,""Hi, my name is sophia, and im concerned because im on antidepressants now have veen for the past 10 years, 5 years ago i was feeling horribly UID1183 and my doctor increased my medication, So now im feeling so UID1183 again, what will happen, can my medication im on now be increased again or do i need to try another type of medication, I have had to cope through alot of stuff in the last couple of years, i was diagnosed with colon cancer 18 months ago, went through chemotherapy and radiotherapy had surgery to remove tumor, Lived with an ileostomy for 8 months, had that removed, lost my job of 7 years, went through fair work proceedings got paid out a minimal amount, Just didnt have the strength to appeal the decision, and let it go, I caught a cold and its turned into bronchitis that i cant seem to shake off, All these things i believe have contributed to me feeling UID1183 like this again, Especially the chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the treatment took every bit of strength, even after finishing treatment 18 months ago, I cant get back physical or mentally the way i was before my cancer diagnosis, what do i do, have my medication increased again or try a different type of medication,"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Post Graduate Depression ,UID372,""I graduated uni in June 2017 after a final 6 week internship at the end of my degree. I struggled to get through the internship as my mentor and I did not mesh so well and I felt anything but positive vibes from her. I constantly felt like I wasn't doing a good job despite getting a good report from her. All my previous pracs in my degree I received nothing but high praise from all mentors. Anyway once I finished my degree a full time position had opened up at my current employment which I took. (For reference I studied a bachelor of primary education and I was working at a before and after school care as an assistant). I took on the coordinator position at the before and after school care. I was comfortable UID3760 and I knew exactly what I was doing. For a while I used the excuse that I was taking a gap year for myself before I went into full time teaching but the reality was the thought of teaching and getting a graduate job made me physically sick. All i could think about was how I'm not very good and I'm going to be a horrible teacher who has no idea what to do so what is the point. a year later and I'm still trying to cope with my anxiety around teaching and I'm also considering if maybe I should choose and different job all together. However recently my work lost the tender at the school where we run our after school care, meaning a new company will come in and take over and we are all loosing our positions. This is stressful in itself. The new company has encourage us all to apply for positions but has told us we will still need to go through the full interview process. This is very upsetting because I feel like I have to interview to keep my job and I'm worried that other people applying will get it over me because UID1518 probably have more experience in the position then i do. My anxiety has been through the roof just dealing with this alone I can't sleep and I've been calling in sick to work because I can't bring myself to go knowing I might not be there anymore at all. A part of me is saying go and use your degree and get a job as a teacher but again the thought makes me sick and I already know I'm no good anyway. Then this thought makes me feel like such an idiot I wasted my time at uni to study a degree im going to do nothing with. This disapointment I have in myself hurts so much I just don't see the point in anything. I feel like I've let everyone in my life down and like I'm going to go no where so why even bother continuing."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I'm not sure if I'm depressed again,UID372,I went off my medication and stoped seeing my theripast last year because my parents pressured me to. I chose to in the end because I was too anxious at the the sessions with my therapist and never ended up improving anything. My parents complained about the cost of therapy and told me that the drugs weren't UID1059ing me and were actually unhealthy. I'm scared to tell them how scared and sad I feel all the time for no reason. I act normal and try not to show it and everyone has been telling me how much better I'm doing. But I'm really not enjoying anything and I spend so much time mulling over trying to find joy in anything I never really feel happy. I always want to go out with my friends but when I do I feel like I'm searching for a feeling that isn't there anymore and feel isolated from them. I'm not sure if I would be able to go back on medication or see a therapist again but I'm not really sure how to feel good about myself either. I keep taking on new projects and trying my hardest to UID1059 people but it's hard because I feel so alone and no one really wants to UID1059. It's scary talking about it because I feel like when I told people last time UID1518 treated me different and my parents tell me how happy UID1518 are that I'm better. I don't feel better. I dont really know what to do. But I don't feel like it's going to get better soon. It's so hard to get up for school in the morning and the whole day I'm just waiting to come home. I'm tired all the time and I can't sleep at night feeling like this. I don't understand any reason why I could feel this number empty or alone mabye I'm just making up that I'm UID1183. I'm going to school fine and I'm not failing classes anymore. I'm so confused and scared I don't really know what to do. I feel like no one really likes me no matter what UID1518 say and nothing I do is right no matter how well I go or what people say about the end result. It's so exhausting. I just want to give up.

"Looking for understanding of my journey with depression,UID372,""I don't get it!! I try hard, very hard in life!! I've stopped drinking, I have a conscience, I treat others with respect and try and live life right. Just because I haven't done anything dramatic or hit the traditional rock-bottom I feel people don't understand the hell I go through. They don't see or know that every day for me is a personal hell of over-thinking, self-doubt, resentment and loathing of the way my life has panned out. I haven't had any relationships with women ruined for instance (a common """"rock-bottom"""" consequence with men) because quite simply I've never been able to develop one. It is so hard going every day so alone and misunderstood!! I hate going to GPs and just getting the same mental health assessment done when the stuff going on in my head is so difficult to explain.

"I feel as though I am stuck,UID372,""I’m a 24-year-old female who was first diagnosed with depression, GAD and PTSD and 16. I grew up in a turbulent and violent household which had an overwhelming impact on my life. Since then, I have always been on this “roller coaster” of mental health. Consistent highs and lows. UID2181 at 24, I feel more confused, afraid and alone than I ever have before. I have no one to talk to about what is going on in my head, and when I have talked about it I’m met with responses such as: “do you think you’re the only one?” and “all you do is complain and I’ve reached my threshold with you”. This has come from family, friends and worst of all, my partner. I feel so desperately alone and I’m struggling to maintain my life. I work 3 days a week and attend university and every single day is a battle to manage, both work and uni have suffered because most days I struggle to leave my house. For the past 2-3 years, I’ve been addicted to smoking marijuana. It is a secret that I have kept from every single person in my life, and it’s the only thing that UID1059s me to feel ok. I have no motivation to do anything else, I don’t enjoy anything that I used to enjoy. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to live but I’m too scared to die. I don’t know who to talk to or where to turn. I feel like I’m being tortured by my own mind. I just don’t know what to do and I’m scared.

"Depression and physics,UID786,""What has UID1059ed me almost fully recover with depression is tricking my mind. That is, I usually dont know if a thought, a system or a philosophy works or not...but I'll try anyway based on the logic. """"A ball wont bounce unless it rapidly drops"""". We panic when we fall heavily into depression. Being a motivated person Im always looking for the positve...the bouncing ball tells me that there must be a reason we fall into that state and the ball, like our depression must hit rock bottom before the journey to recovery begins. It might not be """"right"""" theoretically however when Ive been rock bottom Ive then waited for the up cycle to appear and like that bouncing ball.. Went on the rise. What if that ball bounces down the road.up, down, up, down..many times until UID3800 it bounces into your hand where you can have some control of it. It will..believe it. Another physics idea is empty/replace. So if you treat your depression as an intruder of your brain. To reduce its size we must replace parts of it with other volume items..like- a hobby, sport, social, activity, jigsaw...keep moving, replace, replace. If you be idle for too long your depression grows. Deptession loves boredom. Easier said than done? I know, I've been there many times. But this mentality is but one way to assist in beating the black dog. Stimulation. You are deeply UID1183. In a matter of moments you reverse your mind to do the opposite of what you are allowing it to do. Google Topic: switching mindsets- UID2631 UID1306 you suddenly decide to go parachuting or paying passenger in a race car?.

"Bipolar downers,UID786,""I have depression down times, constant depression in the form of Dysthymia and bipolar down periods. They are all distinctly different. Depression when it hits can make me tired but that is more like what my wife feels and she hits the bed. For me it’s a time when I feel suppressed, emotional, foggy head and no motivation. Dysthymia is a depression that is forever present. Thankfully my positive mind over rides that most times and it is easier to live with. But bipolar down times are the most difficult of all. It’s like living on a cliff edge with your feet trying to push you away from that edge only UID3800 something or someone gives you a push. Over you go. That person is called “life”. One example. We had visitors UID1861. Before UID1518 came we cleaned up the house, packed away stuff and even cleaned the car. All was set for a bbq in out entertainment area. We were all seated and my lovely niece commented “there’s a spider web up there”. Boom! The bipolar mood struck. Sensitivity on a global scale! With my bipolar mood it hits like a slap in the face, I can never reply during such a time, I have a desperate need to run away and on this occasion I slipped into my bedroom for a while, deep breaths. In years gone by it would be a case of crying my eyes out but I’m 62 now and I’ve learned a little about how to face the challenge of returning to the group as if nothing happened…after about an hour. It is important to let you know that this bipolar reaction is unavoidable. It’s something we have to live with. I’m on Ad’s (small amount) and mood stabilisers that have a great daily stabilizing effect for me. But its these downers through the slightest trigger that sets me off. To suggest finding courage to return to the fold is an understatement, its taken me many years of changing my mindset of allowing the bipolar to take a firm grip to reversing that trend and returning to normal life and family. So my method/routine is to do this- UID372emove yourself calmly from the group Take deep breaths Find distraction (I get on a forum) Go for a short walk Accept that it isn’t the other persons fault UID372ejoin the group with a joke or humour You might have your own routine.

"Depression and the timing of motivation,UID786,""Speaking from experience, if your depression has an obvious cycle to you, timing of your motivation could be in vain. It could be counter-productive when you don't reach your basic goals of fitness. Ever done some jogging when UID1183 and fallen into an emotional heap? Often we read in these pages sufferers that try everything known to man in motivating themselves while in a mental down time. But isn’t this a similar concept to that old and common saying “just snap out of it”? We cant just do that, we know that, then why would we try the same in a physical sense? style=""""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt";"> Accepting our illness is essential as the thread talks about (google) “Topic: Acceptance- is this our biggest challenge- UID2631” and motivation is another step we need to gather an inner strength, as part of our good management. How do we do this.? UID372ecent studies suggest that that annoying depressive cycle when it arrives is best left to run its course however long that might take. So fighting it is a waste of time. Going for a walk might well UID1059 but not intense exercise thinking you'll break that cycle. Considering this revelation, motivation strategies are best placed on hold. My wife and I go to the gym 3 times a week for over 45 minutes of intense training. I was 131kg 9 months ago and unfit with a poor diet. We’d arrive and hop on the treadmill for minimum 20 minutes. This time period I was told allows the heart to get fit. Any less time and it’s a waste of effort as the blood pressure drops then rises again before 20 minutes, thus its good cardio training. Then weights for the rest of the time. However, several times I’ve arrived to get on the treadmill and only lasted 2-3 minutes. My mind was UID1183 maybe stressed…it has to be clear and content to do that machine. I think this is a reflection of what I’m talking about. style=""""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt";"> When we attend the gym and I’m not UID1183 at all, I accelerate my training, stay for over an hour and really put in. Furthermore I’m capable of lowering my food intake and eat healthier foods. I've lost 9kg. Based on this, it could be advisable to commit yourself more to your motivation regime when not UID1183. Whatever you choose in terms of exercise, it is well known that physical exercise, like adequate sleep and relaxation is essential to the well being of the sufferer of the black dog. Cant motivate yourself? UID372elax, do some muscle tensioning exercises and don't worry. Wait for that cycle to go by then run like the wind… UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Mood changers,UID786,""It is understandable that those with mental illness are more moody. An extreme of this is bipolar. Moods are an inherent part of day to day life...such is why mood stabilizer medication is usually prescribed. Along with such medication, bipolar or not, we should seek a bundle of remedies to approach our illness. Just like relaxation is good for anxiety and therapy good for BPD sufferers, a multi pronged approach is the best way. With moods we can add these ideas to our arsenal. We have several body sensors that can trigger good feelings and alter our mood. With the mind we should feed it. Give it what it wants. What is clear is that just remaining stagnant saying to yourself """"I'm in a bad mood"""" is not allowing for any stimulation and we don't believe we can be stimulated because of our mindset. Bad moods are like automatic negative irritations that we think are not controllable, not unlike depressive states. We can usually do something about it. UID372emember the senses and the apology to the person on the receiving end of our mood. It might not be your fault but it certainly isn't theirs.

"Depression, the benefits of physical exhaustion,UID786,""I first stumbled on this in 1997. I hadn’t been diagnosed with depression and bipolar until 6 years later but know now I had them all along. UID372ecovering from a marriage split with kids involved, survived a suicide plan in full swing and heavily UID1183 when I moved into a caravan park it seemed all downhill from there but I decided to rebound. To get myself financially ahead I worked 3 jobs including one shift work. I purchased a block of land and ordered a kit home, a two storey quaker barn to be used as a house. Suddenly I was flat out either working or building. My only day off was UID3800 a fortnight while I had my kids but even then as UID1518 played hop scotch on the house slab I toiled cleaning up or moving things. I became physically exhausted. I know this because I had a delivery of 60 sheets of plaster. Huge sheets by any standards and I had to cut them smaller to hang pieces on the wall. After several days the stack of sheets didn’t seem to have reduced and my old back injury returned. Suddenly, the thought of failing overwhelmed me and I collapsed in a blubbering heap. Ten minutes later I got up, made myself a brew then got stuck into it again. How? Well, I’d been conditioned to be positive and never give up. Always seek the positive…and the positive was- that I was so exhausted I slept well and no longer dwelled on my ex wife and her childish antics and emotional abuse. I was proud I was succeeding albeit on my own during late nights with candlelight. Since then I’ve always taken on challenges to over exert myself so I sleep better. This is particularly good for ADHD sufferers or those that have guilt or mania or dwell on issues. Being active means keeping your mind in constant activity, a busy frame of mind, always thinking, always doing, not stopping except for sensible breaks. There are spin offs. You succeed in doing something, creating, re-establishing your life. What's the motivation? well look for one. In my case I'd lost my home, neighbours, dog, full time fatherhood. My ex got the house and I got our garage. My motivation? Get my house back by my own hands! Any regrets? Well yes, I could have done with a smaller home and employed a tradesman or two. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. You can do other things to make yourself spent like sports and hobbies. While you are exhausted you might well be thinking of a troublesome topic but you aren’t beating yourself up. Better than moping any day. Achieve and be proud.

"Where is this coming from? Is it really depression or depression from something else?,UID325,""Hi All I had my first bout of depression over 20 years ago from an Hormonal Injection. I recovered well and had never had another episode until May this year. I started not feeling well and not sleeping well. I started working because all the symptoms of depression were there and I am perimenopausal. I gave myself anxiety just dreading falling into the dark hole. Bam......next thing depression. A depression far worse than before. Back to a psychiatrist who gave me medication and the journey began. But this time weeks went by and I wasn't really getting anywhere. I had used both medications before but this time my body just didn't feel right. Weird side effects and the fatigue was awful. I was no longer the woman I was multitasking and getting everything done. I couldn't concentrate couldn't think what to have for dinner everything that was once simple became my nightmare. I went to my GP often as I trusted her more than my psychiatrist! She ordered full bloods yet again and Bingo there it was! My calcium as well as parathyroid levels were higher than UID1518 should be. I was then sent for an Ultrasound of the thyroid. Bingo there it was again. An enlarged parathyroid gland. Believe me when I tell you these little glands control the hormones in your body and when UID1518 malfunction can rock your world. One of the most common side effects is depression and generally not feeling well. I am booked to see a surgeon in the new year to get rid of this enlarged parathyroid gland. All it takes is 20mins. Within 2months I will be able to wean off my medication. If you don't feel right and you are being treatment resistant, keep pushing until you find the answer. I'm so overjoyed to finally get to the answer that caused this depression. I hope you are able to get to yours. Will repost after surgery.

"Workplace absenteeism ,UID786,""Depression is one of the major contributors to mounting sick days. Its as if, we will get better, then we wont take so much time off. But its short lived. The ramifications are big. Your boss increases his frustration whether you know it or not, it will be there.

If you can secure a couple of part time jobs you will have more variety and sometimes more total income but less security. Another tactic to rise in the morning is baby steps. When I worked in my own business I had to rise at 3am then drive 1-3 hours to my workplace. When first waking up to the alarm if I thought about the drain of the next 3 hours I'd stay in bed. My method was to focus just in getting into the shower. Hot water stimulates you, UID1059s you wake up. UID372emember breakfast. Confidentiality - your workmates will judge you negatively. You owe them nothing. I always go on a """"need to know"""" basis. """"Just personal problems"""" as a reply to gossipers covers a lot of possibles. Let them guess. Trust one colleague and rumours will flow. Holidays- make them count. Being idle or working at another job is not taking a break. Google Topic: holidays- UID2631 Topic: cheap recovery idea, camping- UID2631 Following many sick days off you might have to take a punt and disclose to your boss your predicament which means telling him/her about your illness amd how you have battled with it. This happened to my friend that worked in retail. His travel time was one hour by train and a 15 minute bus. His boss had a wife with depression and sympathized. He arranged a transfer to a store closer to home. It was the answer. Taking sick days isnt ideal. Discuss medication and sleep patterns with your doctor. UID372estructure your life, consider all options and limit your guilty feelings. And try one step at a time starting with a long shower.

"Breaking,UID372,""Hi 👋 Im not sure where to start really. I’m 30 years old, married with 4 small children. I used to be happy, excited about life. I’m just ridiculously sad and miserable all the time now. I can’t envision anything in the future ever exciting me again. I honestly feel like life is breaking me. I feel like I really need to talk to someone but then so much crazy shit goes on in my head i can’t tell that to anyone! I don’t know what to do or how to learn to be happy with my life. Does anyone else feel like this? I don’t know how I’m going to get through the rest of my life sometimes."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Getting depression into perspective. Please read this, it might help YOU,UID786,""Every now and then, along comes an article that blows your mind and makes incredible sense.

"Depression...a ship on the high seas,UID786,""UID1306 it. You are a ship in the ocean. 'Normal people' live on land and you visit there often but you are drawn back to your ship at the docks only to be sent off again on a trip to the high seas (depression) But there is no destination and no adventure In the ocean all alone you shut down the engine because- well there is no sense in proceeding when you have not directional control - no rudder (medication). Perhaps your parents were also born without one, or you had an incident or your construction is made of soft wood. So you go into the dry dock. Here you are dried of all control where others can evaluate you, ask you questions and repaint you. They install your rudder then put you out to sea. You head off with complete control but you have no map (therapy) nor do you have any contact with others (land) and others feel """"out of sight out of mind"""". Land is not life on the high seas- UID1518 wont understand. Only sailors do. You search through to find comfort to find a map but this map has missing pieces (consultations), much searching is needed to find the missing bit to join them together.(therapy sessions). During this voyage your rudder is unreliable, the linkages are fragile. Your direction is always vague. You stand on the bridge with waves drenching your face often. You often want to kiss the world goodbye as you feel irrelevant, often adrift without energy. Some ships make it to shore but have to use anchors to land so UID1518 repel the forces that drag them back out to sea. Being a ship you will never be thrown onto land like most. But you do get some people waving at you from the shore. Lovely but not enough to call it support. And you do get the odd ship passing by throwing a rope ladder to connect you so you dont feel all alone, nice, but UID1518 also have their own problems as UID1518 are ships themselves. You accept that you are indeed a ship and always will be. You also realise that you can let out all of your emotions when ever you want,in your own hull. The echoes are deafening. The dock managers (psych's) know your struggle but when at sea if you have no rudder (meds) UID1518 cannot UID1059 you.And if you do not have therapy (maps) you cannot find direction.As you are a ship you will never get to be on land and return to the docks. You must fix your rudder,you must find all parts to your map and piece them together,you must make the interior of your ship seaworthy (caring for yourself). Then you can be repaired so you can anchor yourself to shore. A safe ship"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Why does the depression change you so much?,UID372,""Hi. This is my first post. My situation is that my wife of 33 years has told me she thinks that she wants to seperate and, although she loves and cares for me she feels no affection.I still adore her. I have had a breakdown and am on medication and it only works half time. I have an appointment with a psychologist but not for another 2 weeks, but have been using all the material that I can get hold of. Yesterday I had a number of black out moments that my wife thought was sleep walking. I was talking to myself and gave her a massage in the middle of the night, none of which I remember. I did take a sedative as well and have had bad experiences with it in tbe past. Last night I read an email to a male friend that I have jealousy issues over and felt there was something going on. There wasn't. I immediately regretted what I did and told her about it. She has not reacted with anger but we havn't spoken any more about it. It has been 3 weeks since my breakdown and I have put a lot of things in place that I think will UID1059 but it just seems like I take 1 step forward and start to feel better and next thing I am back to where I started from, in tears and shaking etc. I have not been physically violent with her but I tend to not talk for weeks in the past. I hope to become a better person with treatment and address all of my past but I have never felt like this before. Any advice from people as to what I can do that has UID1059ed you out I would really appreciate. Thank you all in advance"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"I've just been rejected by a job by indicating I've had depression,UID322,""I thought I was being honest by saying I'd had depression. It was a medical assessment as the last step before taking the job. I'd already been offered the job (over the phone)";" my referees had given me a 'glowing report'. Then, out of the blue, the day after the medical assessment UID1518 called to say the job had changed and I wouldn't UID3584t their new criteria. (The medial assessment came after two successful interviews, a psychometric test and referee check). So I've done some research this morning and apparently it's a bad idea to mention this upfront to a potential employer - because despite all the pretence about diversity, it's ultimately about the business bottom line and you're therefore potentially a liability. (Even if the depression was in the past).

"It never lets go does it.,UID1664,""I was starting to believe that my constant companion, my pervasive melancholy, had given up and left my body/psych. I had 11 days where I felt normal, not manic, not UID1183, just normal or what I call it at least. Nothing was an effort, I was functioning at a level I had forgotten about. It was wonderful and it was noticed by family and friends and I felt on top of life for the first time in years. But my 11 days of mental peace has evaporated and has plunged me back to what has become my tortured life. Nothing happened in my life that gave me 11 days of respite and nothing happened that took that away and therefore I am even more convinced that depression has brain chemical impacts of some description. For a while I had hope that this mental affliction had run its course, but no. I think it would have been better not to have experienced the brief lifting of the swirling black fog that many of us live with. I've not had much success with medication in the past, perhaps its time to try again although it is difficult living in the bush.

"I really want to be happy.,UID3942,""I guess I just need to get this off my chest. There's a billion things I could say but, one of them is just being unable to be happy no matter what I do. I've had severe depression for three years, and I'm fairly sure I had a less severe type of depression before it became severe, I just don't know for how long I had it. Anyway, I'm rarely excited about anything anymore no matter how hard I try to keep myself happy and busy with things to do. I indulge in activities that I enjoy and even go outside my comfort zone every once in a while but I'm still unhappy. And I know it's just the depression doing that, I know that if I wasn't UID1183 I would be more happy and motivated and feel like the doing the things that I know I want to do. I know nobody can be happy all the time but it just doesn't feel right when I'm unhappy in times where I'd usually be excited or motivated. Holidays don't make me happy. Events don't make me happy. Buying stuff I really want or playing video games makes me pretend I'm happy but I can't actually feel it. Art used to make me feel imaginative and creative. Even hanging with friends, I feel like I'm not really there. I try sooo hard to be happy or excited or glad etc. about things, but in the end I really don't actually feel any of it. I guess I really want to also ask if taking medication UID1059s with this feeling or if I'll become more apathetic. I just want to be happy. UID372eally that's all I care about anymore. I want to feel like my life is worth it again. Any success stories (or even non successful stories) people can share with me? Has anyone started being happy after dealing with severe depression? (I say severe because even some of my UID1183 friends don't understand me not being happy because UID1518 don't have the same severity of depression I guess) I'm really hoping that seeing a psychiatrist goes well for me.

"So over it!,UID325,""Hi All Decided to rant because I am so over this depression! My first depression was over 23 years ago. I have been on an antidepressant ever since and never had another episode until May this year. I was quick to pick up the signs and finally got into see a psychiatrist at the end of June. I was put back into the same combination of medication that got me well the first time. Wow some of the side effects I never had all those years ago, I definitely have this time! I have an amazing partner who is both supportive and loving. He is my Tower of strength both episodes. This time around it's a bit harder having though having 2 teenage children. I haven't told the kids as UID1518 would take it very hard. It has been 10 weeks or so since beginning medication. I am no longer low but still haven't returned to myself. I find this so hard to deal with. I find the everyday tasks a challenge, just thinking of what to have for dinner every night does my head in. I feel I am constantly counting the days, weeks,months that this has been going on. I get so upset that I'm not 100%. I feel like I am letting down my husband and kids. School holidays are coming up and I was unable to take the kids anywhere in the last holidays. My husband says I'm too hard on myself but I am just so over it.

Depression: The beast won't let me speak everything,UID372,Hi I recently joined the Army 7 months ago but for the past 5 years I've been suffering from depression however during those years I didn't know much about depression and thought that my internal struggles were normal. But things started to get worse and I did some researching and from the info I gathered from mental health websites such as Beyond Blue I was indeed suffering from depression. I sought UID1059 through the Army and went to see a Psychologist but the worst thing was I couldn't tell her everything. I only told her about 10 percent of what's really going on. It's like there was an invisible force preventing me from saying everything I just couldn't do it . I hate that at the most crucial moment to actually get UID1059 I was weak.

"Forced holiday from work,UID372,""I work as a kindy educator and have been under a lot of stress this year. I have a really challenging class who have lots of undiagnosed developmental concerns. The parents on the whole are needy, demanding and do my head in every day. I have told my managers so many times that the children and the parents are getting to me and UID1518 just say I should ignore it, not stress so much, not let it get to me etc. All the patronising cliches but no acknowledgement of what it's doing to me or offers to UID1059 in any real way. A week ago a group of parents began to criticise me publicly and described me as rude and unapproachable (this feels like the fallout of """"ignoring them"""" as I was encouraged to do). My managers brought it up with me... UID1518 believe UID1518 were doing their job but it just felt like I'm being targeted by these parents and i don't know why UID1518 hate me so much. This week I've tried to move on and forget about it, but it started within 30 minutes on Monday. Parents complaining, children having meltdowns, staff numbers being low and just feeling like I'm on a knifes edge. A colleague complained to my managers that I'm so stressed and negative that it's uncomfortable for others. Called in to the office again. They suggested I take a week off to """"have some me time"""" and """"put myself first"""". I was so upset I couldn't even respond to half of what UID1518 were saying. I felt like I was in trouble for not coping. All I want (as childishas it seems) is for someone to just have my back and feel like UID1518're seeing how sad I am. Instead it was like being scolded for not being happy enough. I've now had to explain to my partner that I'm off work and feel pathetic and useless. I love my job and care so much for these kids... but there is only so much I think I can take of being kicked when I'm down. I can't stop crying, I can't eat and I'm so exhausted I can hardly get up out of bed. I now have ten days without work where I'm supposed to do things that make me happy so I can come back and just... be great I guess. UID3474 where to start when I can't stomach the thought of ever going back. I feel such shame, guilt and despair that i can't even cope being a freaking kindy teacher. It shouldn't be this hard.

"I think I'm finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel,UID325,""Hi Everyone I'm new to the site, but not to depression. I had an episode over 20years ago and have been well since then until May this year. I can assure you I was totally amazed that I was once again heading into a darkness I never thought I would see again. This episode has been nowhere near as bad as my first one but debilitating to say the least. UID486 time in my life with 2 teenage children to worry about , and not letting on that I'm not 100%. I can't tell them.....UID1518 would be devastated. I am lucky enough to still have the same loving and supportive man in my life that was there for the first episode. I have hated every minute of this episode and can't wait for it to be over. I have been counting down the days weeks and months! Finally I am into my 9th week of medication and I'm starting to lift. Fingers crossed this continues to be the case. To those that are struggling , be rest assured there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep pushing and trying everyday no matter how hard it is. Set just one goal everyday and achieve it. All those years ago when I became well after my depression, I felt grateful that I have suffered. It made me a better person, more compassionate , caring as well as patient. May whatever demons you are fighting start to lift.

"Running out of time...,UID372,""It's 5am and my mind is still very active. UID2327es like these I'm bombarded with a myriad of feelings and thoughts. Mostly of worry/fear, deep regret and painful memories. I've been diagnosed with depression/anxiety and mood disorder";" and have been receiving treatment and medication for almost a decade now. The symptoms may have been around since i was in high school. I am now entering my 40s and I am disturbed by the fact that i have lost so many years to depression and solitude. I am still hopeful that things would turn out fine but i am afraid that time is running out for me to live life to the fullest. It all started in school, i was badly bullied, mostly emotional (i would rather have been beaten up than called names). I was publicly humiliated on many occassions. The most traumatic was during my highschool graduation where UID1518 sang a corrupted version of the garduation song to humiliate me. What should've been one of the happiest moments in my life turned out to be a nightmare that would haunt me for years. I was fed up. I swore to myself that i would never be in that situation again. I changed my persona to one that was a complete contrast of my former self. One day, my worst bully came up to me and bitch slapped me with a newspaper in front of a crowd. By then I had developed a fairly good reputation that i felt i had to keep, so with the little dignity i had, i was able to muster the courage to fight back. So i got up and punched the guy in the face. He was petrified, he retaliated with nothing but words and walked away. After what happened we became friends and i became one of 'them'. Part of me had died the day i punched the bully. I began to lived a life of pretence, i was conceited, arrogant, extroverted yet introverted. Behind the facade was i was shy and insecure. I developed trust issues and attitude problems. I started losing friends and began to have difficulty any form of work. I dumbed down, barely passed college and always had difficulty in my job. After so many years of sad and traumatic experiences, I became an escapist. I kept mostly to myself, playing video games, surfing the net, playing the guitar, and procrastinating. With each passing day i still hope that someday i would discover my true self and become happy and successful. I pray that it happens soon as i fear that i am getting old. My shyness and lack of skills has made it difficult if not impossible to get me out of my predicament It seems like only a miracle can UID1059 me."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I have informally been diagnosed with GAD and mild social anxiety however lately I feel like I am UID1183 also. I'm in my second year at Uni studying Speech Pathology, living 6 hours away from my family and 7 hours from my boyfriend. I have quite a few friends where I am, and am living with 4 lovely people who I get along well with. I just feel so lonely and isolated from everyone and everything. I find myself not wanting to get out of bed, not wanting to talk to people. My appetite is very small and very unhealthy. I am finding that I am less interested in things I usually would be excited or happy about. I have also recently stopped seeing my psych as I didn't like her, but had only been to 3 sessions. So I should probably be looking for a new one. I have a good relationship with my family, however UID1518 just don't quite understand, though UID1518 do try their best to support me. My boyfriend is wonderful, he puts up with my crying over the phone almost every time I talk to him and deals with my mood swings constantly. I feel so bad that I am always getting annoyed with him over the littlest things, but it's never anything I should be cranky about. I just don't know what to do. I'm so sick of crying all the time, I find myself getting angry over the smallest things and I just can't keep control of my mental health, my mood or my life.

The last few years I have had pnuemonia, cancer, deviated septum surgery, constant colds and flus, insulin resistance, migraines, ulcerative colitis... The list goes on and on. I can't remember the last time I was okay! I have tried so hard to combat this with regular exercise when I'm not bed bound And eating ridiculously healthy but it doesn't seem to work and I'm continually putting on weight. I had to quit my job because I was told, how can you look after sick people if you are so sick all the time, you should stop working in X profession because you are shit at being healthy and are letting the team down. I was bullied Everytime I showed up to work with a medical certificate and accused of """"faking it"""" As well as this I have lost multiple friendships over me being sick and friends telling me that I haven't put the effort in, despite when UID1518 have been sick in the past I've been the first person there to UID1059. To add to this, I have recently been told I won't be able to conceive children because of my array of health problems and recent diagnosis of PCOS. This really is affecting my relationship with my husband as he is the first born child and only one to pass on the family name and I've basically screwed our chances of having children just because of being me. We both agreed we wanted kids and he has always said that if this changes it would be a deal breaker (back when we were dating) I honestly feel useless. I can't go back to work because I'm too sick. Too sick to conceive a child. Been exercising and eating healthy yet can't shed any weight off. The last time I was severely UID1183 I was a young teen at home, being physically, emotionally and financially abused by my parents at home and socially isolated from all my friends, but I had my grandparents to UID1059 me out. This time though, UID1518 have been gone for quite sometime, I have no friends and I feel like if I tell my husband im slipping back into bed depression we will have no marriage/relationship either. On top of this, the unit we rent is being sold and we are being asked to move. It's been difficult to find anywhere to live as we have a pet and so far all of my applications to new places have been rejected. I have previously tried Lexapro consistently for a year with no luck.

"Blame, guilt and being fair to yourself,UID786,""Do you blame yourself for the mistakes you've made? Do you feel guilty about them? Do you spent time dwelling about """"what could have been""""? I use to until I realised, that you are only responsible to limit our mistakes in the UID3760 and now. Once that decision making has been made, if it was the wrong one, it was only wrong after making it. But punishing ourselves year in year out is not clever, its responsive and harms us. Eg For whatever reason I grew up impulsive problem I now dont have. Such a trait resulted in buying and selling 35 cars before the age of 23yo and as UID1518 were on loans I got myself into heaps of financial trouble. My family heard my justifications each new car I purchased, friends laughed but it was a serious issue. As the years rolled by I dwelled on those impulsive years and beat myself up about them. But was it my fault? We end up as we are for a reason. In my case it could be I needed attention, needed change often, liked different cars in my driveway or got tired of one car quickly and desired another. Or my mothers BPD (undiagnosed) had its effect on us kids. Whatever the real reason, it wasnt fault on my part. There is only fault when one doesnt learn and improve on the situation as best one can. As time went by I tried to keep a car for long periods. By 30yo I kept a car for 3 years, by 40yo 5 years and now my new csur purchased in 2008 I still have. In my 20's my then girlfriend had had a baby adopted out when she was 16yo, 8 years earlier before I met her. We split after 6 years then met up 20 years later. She'd spent many a restless night dwelling on that one mistake, to give up her baby. I told her that under the same UID2106rcumstances she would have done the same thing, she would bow to the pressures from family, no means to support her baby and the stigma from that era. Essentially, blaming herself was unfair. What would be more unfair is to not search for her child and UID1059 her child through life by knowing her birth mother. We met up again 10 years later. She told me she found her child, now with children of her own. She had accepted it was unrealistic and hurtful to lay blame on herself for giving up her own baby. She has some lingering guilt, wished things were different and still takes medication for depression. Importantly, her self blame has drifted. She is now an active granny. She progressed. Blame and guilt are suppressive thoughts that need to be contained. Be fair to yourself. UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Sad all the time? Dysthymia,UID786,""It's difficult to describe but if you see and feel sadness in most things in life you could have dysthymia. Constant, uncontrollable crying, thinking often about sad topics. A proper diagnosis is needed. This illness generally develops prior to adulthood and can be described as a constant low mood depression. You can google """"dysthymia mood disorder"""" to receive a full description. The disorder makes one feel alone, desperate and unusual. I have a friend I went to school with, he never cried in 35 years I knew him until his father died. He was uncontrollable that funeral day. The next day we chatted. I mentioned that his state the day before was how I felt every second day. He got some idea of the magnitude. Soon after I got the diagnosis Bipolar2, depression, anxiety and...dysthymia. my psychiatrist discovered that a near drowning of my brother when I was 12yo was the spark, the shock that set it off. I didnt talk for 3 months after that incident and was highly emotional ever since until 2009 when he prescribed medication. Since then my life has turned around in terms of sadness. If you believe your level of sadness is high, constant and you feel desperate, even suicidal, you might have dysthymia. It effects more women than men, can come about if you have a parent with a mental illness or if you suffered trauma at a young age. Seek UID1059. The difference to your life will be much more positive. UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I just want to be happy,UID372,""I've dealt with depression since my teens but I always hid it well. I always smiled made jokes anything to make sure my family and friends didn't need to worry until it caught up with me and I became exhausted and couldn't put up the masks anymore. I've been on medication regularly for 4 to 5 years, But I can't seem to break the curse, lately it feels like it's gotten worse. 2 days ago I actually let myself do what I call a depression sleep. It's that sleep of mental exhaustion and the thought of getting up was too much to handle so I sleep the day away as my partner and our son were at work and school. We moved UID3760 so my partner could take a job at the university. I'm originally from the US and thought I would pick up my career just as I did in the last country we lived in.I wrong, so I took a part time job below my skill set so I could get my masters degree, I finished last year and for the past year no job, not even in my own company. So I find myself trying to take more courses, apply for more jobs , my family is doing well UID3760 in Perth , I'm so proud of how my son is growing and how much enthusiasm my partner has , and I feel like what am I doing wrong?I find myself homesick quite often,envious of past colleagues, and find myself getting angry with the managers I work,all of I feel is just petty.Digging deeper, I've never not had a career since I was 18, my parents are not doing well and I can't send them my hard earned money I send my partners, my son isn't seeing what I hoped he'd be seeing which is a successful accomplished person, I feel as if I'm not wanted UID3760, I've dealt with more bouts of bigotry UID3760 than I have in US or UID372SA and I struggle to not let it get to me but I hide it well cause I don't want my son to understand that part of life yet I want to protect his innocence as long as I can. I don't want my partner to know just truly how unhappy I am so I wait to he falls asleep so I can cry to sleep from exhaustion. I just want to blend into Perth and every day I tell my self that I just need to embrace it and I try. I don't give up the job search, I don't let the bigotry seap in, I do what I can to make sure my mom and dad know I love them and am doing my best, and I'm sorry I'm not the independent person that taught me to be, I tell my partner that what counts is that he loves his job because I want him happy. But I'm afraid my lows are coming back that I can't but on a mask of drama or laughter to hide.

"Is anybody there?,UID1664,""Why is it after a number of therapy sessions, trying different therpeutic approaches, research and self analysis, unsuccessful medications, discussions with family and close friends that I feel so misunderstood? I don't blame anyone for this because if I struggle to know self how can anyone else. There doesn't seem to be an answer and I'm slowly losing my grip on the basic realities of life. And that scares me a bit as I feel there is an inevitable conclusion to all this. Does anyone really understand the frigging hopelessness that is depression, the ever present melancholy that won't let go despite concerted effort to shrug it off. There has been recent sportsmen who have """"stepped away from the game to deal with mental health issues"""" and the world goes awww, poor things, only for these guys to appear next week and get on with it. If only it was that easy as its not the depression I know. I've tried everything in order to get a grip on this black dog but nothing seems to work. I'm not after sympathy at all, it's my lot and I'm responsible and I get that. I guess I'm just looking for someone to acknowlege what a bummer this involuntary condition is.

"Is that it, I mean is survival the only thing?...,UID2826,""Forgive me if I'm not grateful for my life in advance. I am grateful for all that I have but it's the ME bit I've never settled with. I go through the motions, go through the necessary things in life and feel settled that I can achieve them. I can look after a house, children and a husband. Over the years I've found new ways of coping with stress and my first thought each day is centered around finding the most effective ways to combat stress, or at least what my brain perceives as possible stress. I'm well aware that others might not find some things that I do as a stressor but I've learnt that I can't afford to focus on their ways because I'm not them. All I can do is focus on myself, the children and my husband. I've dabbled UID3760 and there increasing my duties outside of home etc and for the most part coped ok. The nagging thought I have though in life right now is, is that what my existence is? I mean, is it just survival or will I get further nourishment to top me up? It's like my brain is not getting the feel good endorphin mix, I take a sauna and swim but don't get long term nourishment, I ride my bike but only feel temporary pleasure, I make my jewellery but the creative side fills me only for a second. My brain seems to feel devoid, depleated of a long term satisfaction. I worry that despite me doing things with my children, asking them about their day and generally being there for them that UID1518 feel my dissatisfaction some how. My thick skinned sort of strength though keeps me forcing myself to accept things and keep moving forward or along. I use keeping out of hospital as a yard stick for my own success in dealing with mental illness but sometimes wonder if this is acceptable line of thinking. Again, its all survival based living. Again, I sound like I'm complaining, I should not. It's just a genuine question because I'm doing all the things I can to live a life of harmony but my ability to really feel things is lacking right now. Most people accomodate a broken leg, arm or the like. With mental illness, it's just not possible to get an undertstanding going. How do people out there with mental illness get your struggle across, get an understanding going without upsetting people of what you can cope with? I actually just feel really lonely right now. We have to exist with people, UID1518 are in our lives."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Surface stuff again.,UID2826,""Hi, My name is UID2826 and I've visited UID3760 some 8 months or so ago. I'm feeling a bit lonely in thought right now and just feel the need to talk in an UID1195 where I know others are facing similar issues. At times I just feel a swirl of emotion, I'll wake up and feel I've let everyone down, I'll feel guilt for being me and it's a horrible feeling. I've had to scale down the amount of activity I engage in because the pace my family and I were keeping was driving my state into a knot. I tried making each UID3355day apart from commitments that come along on occasion, a day of 'free' time, that is no commitments. It worked for about a month. We decided on that day if we'd like to take it easy, have unplanned spontaneous time to mearly just walk, ride bike, cook at home or what ever. Our lives have so many activities between both kids sports on Saturdays and week nights already that for family health UID3800 per week Mum had formulated non-scheduled time. For me, it became like needing air, food or water. Space to be just what ever. I could get up and be non-scheduled, non organised. UID372ecently a friend wanted our family to join them on a UID3355day, for which we did. Then she was asking every UID3355day and it become 4 consecutive UID3355days in a row of getting together, BBQ lunch from 11am then afternoon still together and pizzas by dinner and all of us were still together socializing until 7pm or so. I'm lucky to have such people as are my family. But... You see, I feel this is the only spot I can even describe without feeling like a complete outcast, my feelings of disgust at myself. I 'needed' our UID3355day's free for my mental health. But because I felt like I was rejecting her I just kept saying yes. I touched on the fact that I require at least some of our UID3355days to just be unplanned but she looked at me like whatUID50007 I find its beautiful requesting our company, but I strangely can't keep up every weekend. I told her, for my mental health I require to slow things and cant be out or entertaining every UID3355day. I organised our lives to accomodate a need and it just doesnt work. There seems to be no room for looking after mental illness. I feel like no one gets it. I just feel horrible, I feel like I try to accomodate my illness in a busy family but it doesnt match what's going on for other friends, people. So I'm heading down the track again of putting aside what I need and going with what's expected. I don't want us to loose people because I can't keep up."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"*NOTHING CHANGES IF nothing changes*,UID372,""If was almost 2 years ago. At the time life felt grand. I was popular, out at least 2-3 times a week, was known as the social butterfly and was a friend of everyone but in reality, a friend of no one. You could say I've always been an extrovert, confident, happy to approach the unknown and always the 'YES' man in most situations. The reality of being this person over many years and almost like being on 'repeat' was that I thought I had many caring friends around me when in reality all I had were people using me for an excuse to go out, get drunk and for the most part, get high off drugs. Especially when you were the financier for every outing. I felt at the time that by going out and UID3584ting new networks that my depression was in check and I that I was in control and accepted by society. The awful truth though was that every time I got home after a big night I constantly had a thundering and abrupt visit by that person you might be familiar with known as 'depression'. Whenever depression came late at night and tapped me on the shoulder, the feeling was cold, sharp and straight to the heart. Sound nullified, as did any good feeling I had throughout the night and that feeling that I was 'wanted' by someone, anyone. I was in this constant routine until one night when I had a hard reality check. My minute I remember having to go the toilet and the next minute I woke up in the back of an ambulance with no memory. 16 hours of straight drinking and drugs with no food took its toll. I was scared, panicked and felt all alone. I remembered Albert Einsteins definition of insanity: 'Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. It was time for things to change and more importantly, for me to make and action changes. I stopped going out for drinks and instead went out for weekend breakfasts with friends who I had known for a long time and were always there and vice versa, I changed my mobile number and stopped contacting the 'party crowd'. I substituted going out for drinks and alcohol with learning MMA and Brazilian Jui-Jitsu and eating healthy food 5-10 times a week and started watching TedTalks and further enhancing my mind. I also started guitar up again and focused on my career. I also became somewhat of a hermit crab and didn't go out for drinks for 8 months.

"Depression triggers,UID786,""One week ago it happened. A neighbour is a good mate but his wife, a nurse, had her matron hat on when UID1518 visited. Cutting words found their target and once left it was like my brain was being squeezed. I had no control over my mood so, as I usually did, l just allowed the depressive cycle to run its course. Nobody can UID1059 me...but me. I knew not to """"fight"""" it. I also knew not to let myself slide away so l continued with my daily tasks. This time though l wrote out some stickies with the words """"remember when its good, that good will return""""...and stuck them everywhere, the garage, my car, my office and my bedside table. When in our cycle we dont think it will end so we think negatively and although I've not in 20 years gone down the path l did then of two steps from self destruction, l do, while in these cycles...think about it. Why? Because I'm low. It's a hollow sad feeling of UID1059lessness that my good wife can only hold my hand to UID1059.. we watch the UID372osella's feeding, the wild ducks land in our dam and l smile but my laughing was on hold until two hours ago. Two hours ago l walked into my garage and read my sticky...""""remember when its good...."""" l knew l had come out of my cycle and life was good again. One week is a long cycle for me, I'm a 3 day guy nowadays, and pre medicine was a two week guy. At 61yo I'm the result of a narcissistic mother that had all the ingredients for dominance, manipulation and expectation. Nurturing was certainly there but it wasnt enough. So bossy, dominant people often women, triggers my episodes. If UID1518 point their finger and demand you comply then that will trigger it. Knowing a trigger is wonderful. One can work on it to avoid it. Our neighbours came over today. I was quieter, still talking but l had a lump in my emotional throat. My mates wife had no reason to repeat her actions of the week before so the visit went well. Of course the price l paid for harmony was l was not fully myself. As a sufferer that's studied my triggers, l believe most times I'm triggered after becoming sensitive for a few days. I'm learning and its productive. Learning about yourself sounds stupid. But we cannot rely only on meds, psych visits, friends and family to fix us. We have to gently assess ourselves to seek out the pattern as to what sparks the depressive session.

I've been working in a Call Centre role which I thought would be good for me as I'm a caring, empathetic person.

"Depression and concentration,UID786,""There is not much worse a feeling that having what l call a """"scatter brain"""". The term isnt meant to be derogatory, but in fact accurate. When my depression was at its worse 1992-2009,l had extreme difficulty focussing on the job at hand. My mind would wander and this had consequences. Flying a model airplane you need 100% concentration. I often crashed and other modellers wondered why. I'd also fall into an emotional low bevause of it. Mind overload, burnout, stress,all leave our minds in a state that feels like we've lost half of our capacity to think. We have to come to terms with this massive change to our lives.

At least 20 minutes of fast walking will result in the dropping of your blood pressure then it will rise again. Its best for a fit and healthy cardio vascular system. More oxygen for the brain. Check with your GP as to what is advisable. UID372elaxation. Everyone has their own technique. For me its finding a place near home amongst forest trees where l can listen to pan flute music or my favourite Youtube Maharaji UID3355set. It feels like l create empty mind space once l do this. Our minds need time out. Laughter. A good comedy lifts my mood. Prioritise. Focus on one thing at a time. Distractions. My wife and l came to an agreement. If she talks to me and l raise my hand, she knows I'm concentrating on my bb forum. She also knows l will give her attention within a short time. Some of us dont have the capacity to divide our attention to several things at once. We might not be able to focus well, to counter our scattered mind, but we can make changes to move aside some obstacles to give our mind space to think better. Less clutter. Have you got ideas on how to focus better? UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Another Hard Night,UID1471,""Im having a bad night a continuation of a really bad day, Ive really been struggling with my depression lately, more so than ever. I feel like Ive got a battle going on in my mind constantly, there seems to be a good voice and a bad voice and UID1518 fight all the time, which is very difficult to live with, its happening all the time for example, I will try to do something positive which is good but then the bad side says no your not going to do that which pushes me down again. I was wondering does anybody else feel this way and do UID1518 have any advise. I have wonderful medical support and my family are just brilliant for looking after me, for that I will be forever grateful. Thanx for letting me vent BB, I really appreciate this forum.

"Crying, a gauge to our mental strength?,UID786,""UID372eaching 60yo l can reflect on my early life and it is clear that my thousands of buckets l could have filled with my tears is in contrast to the period of post 2009. Why?. Diagnosed in 2009 with bipolar 2,depression, dysthymia and dwindling anxiety meant the correct medication was prescribed. From then on it was more a case of fine tuning dosages. Last week l had the trauma of my youngest daughter leaving my life. She's 24yo and l have been tormented by this development BUT, I havent shead a tear. I feel it is a reflection of my newfound mental strength. Yes she has come and gone in my life but that fact doesnt mean it comes easy to cope with. What else could it be?. After much analysis l think acceptance of what life really is has UID1059ed. Life is not what we plan it to be nor wished. As kids we drew rainbows but not rocks. Life will throw stones, rocks, even boulders- without warning. Is our lack of being able to cope due to us expecting a smooth road in life? Or do we know life has hurdles but when UID1518 arrive its so devastating we have no learned skills to cope with them? At school we had no lessons in """"coping with trauma"""" or """"breaking up with your partner, how to do it with compassion and care"""" or """"depression signs"""" etc.. even financial planning isnt taught. All these life challenges are learned the hard way. Some people can approach such challenges easier than others. So if you are sensitive, had a cruel upbringing, family history of mental illness and so on, you might let your tears become streams. Is it an indicator of your mental strength-lack of it? I suggest it could be. There is no worse feeling imo. That feeling of devastation, worthlessness, failure and mental collapse- crying. However I've known some people equally the same but not crying, with filming over their eyes as if deeply sad without tears so I'm not saying it is the case every time. If you have had a period of lots of crying, to work closely with your professional mental health expert with medication and therapy. Hopefully you'll improve and your stream of tears will dry up. Mine did so there is hope that your mental strength will return or develop even late in life. Accepting life has boulders will prepare yourself for them. Sh*t happens and its out if your control but you can develop strategies to cope better and a mentality that will look at life for what it is and always had been, unpredicable, hurtful but can be wonderful, incredible and more stable UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"DBT, Borderline and my whole world changing.,UID1664,""Hi everyone, Some of you will recognise me (hello again). In the last 3.5 months, I've moved interstate, changed job, put my apartment on the market but continue to pay the mortgaged outgoings, advertised for a tenant, pay rent and outgoings interstate, got ripped off by removalists, My car (worth $5,000) cost me $6,000 That was just before christmas. I went to my GP to see if there was a psychologist I could speak to but I ended up in a mental health facility for christmas and new year. I was coping reasonably after that, but then my car broke down and requires at least $1,000 worth of inspection to determine what's wrong. That's sent me into a hole again with a lot of pain and suicidal ideation. I'm staying with my sister at the moment who is looking after me. My discharge summary from the hospital stay hinted at BPD. After reading a lot about BPD I'm not surprised and it explains a fair bit. I have found a psychologist since moving and she wants to work through DBT (Dialectic Behavioural Therapy) with me which i'm not against and believe that it will be beneficial. Does anyone else suffer BPD and would you like to share your experiences and how you cope? Has anyone been through DBT. Was it group therapy or one on one?

"Depression, how to fight it,UID786,""So you're fed up?. You might have had depression for years. Sometimes you want to give up right?. We all know the feeling. But other times we are functioning OK, good even and we don't know why. That means it has an underlying lack of predictability to it. The mental health professionals know a lot but there are UID3004 gaps in overall knowledge about depression. There is lack of commonality or we'd all read the same book to read up about ourselves. So, that moment you are fed up...you decide to """"fight it"""". Whatever it takes. You push yourself really hard. But I suggest, based on what I've read and subsequently my own practicing of such readings, it isn't the way to go. Ever shadow boxed? You'll never win against an invisable opponent! But you might be able to corral it, corner it so you can live life better, not ideal perhaps but limiting the effects on depression should be your aim. The moment I read an article about 3 years ago that said """" one should allow depressive cycles to run their course not try to hurry up the process"""" I knew I'd been on the wrong track. Over many years I'd had many mental challenges, family, workplace discrimination etc and I fought the maximum within my power so I thought """"I can lick this""""... No I couldn't and such daily determination might be commendable but that doesn't mean its effective. It takes more wisdom. Unfortunately some mental illnesses have symptoms that result in fast thoughts and actions that hide our wisdom. With effective medication and the right dosage our thought processes often slow down and that, in my case resulted in making wiser decisions. The intelligence was always there albeit with a manic blanket covering. Be real. If you are bed ridden then unless you wet the bed you must attend the toilet right? Logical. So you can also rise from bed to greet your carer after a hard days work. At times prepare a brew. Never extend your symptoms. It won't UID1059 you and your carer doesn't deserve it. Spiritual peace. For me it was a crutial element in my recovery. I found Maharaji- and his videos """" sunset"""" and """"the perfect instrument"""" google them. It isn't religion, its a place you can go that provides peace. In time you'll listen daily because of his logic. Measured determination works. But nothing works better in my opinion as does Proper diagnosis Appropriate medication Best dosage Letting cycles run their course Being realistic UID372elaxation And not wasting effort striking the shadow boxer.

"New Here - Struggling and Losing Hope,UID372,""Hi Team, I've heard plenty of awesome things about these forums, and I know how great BeyondBlue as an organisation is to UID1059 with Depression and Anxiety, so I decided to join and tell my story. I've been battling some serious depression and anxiety for 2 years now, and I'm really at a low point. A few points to provide some context, I am a 32 year old male who is an Exercise Physiologist, as well as a Dad to a beautiful infant boy. UID3114 how or why the anxiety or depression started, but each day now is a constant battle. My job requires a lot of positive energy, as well as being a good dad and husband. Energy which, unfortunatley, I just don't have. Of course like everyone I had good and bad days, but the bad days are really bad. As a Health Professional, embarrasing to say my health is probably the worst it's ever been. I am putting on weight/bodyfat due to the almost non stop flow of stress hormones that are absoloutley tearing my nervous system apart. My CNS is drained, depleted, and broken. I'm broken. Apart from the anxiety and depression, I also suffer from OCD, Misophonia (hatred of select sound), ADHD-PI. I know each of these can be related to an overactive nervous system, and gut health, however I'm at a total loss of how I will fix this. I eat plenty of vegetables, keep refined sugars to an absoloute minimum, and limit alcohol. My one vice is caffeine, but working in the job I do, I feel it's the only way I can get through each day. Part of me wants to live in a cave. Part of me wants to stop my job (which I've given up a good government job for and studied for 5 years to get) and focus on my own health while I work a job more suited to depression. I want to get better, and for the sake of my family, will never lose hope. However, I'm completley at a loss as to how to direct my rehabilitation. I've been on AD's which unfortunatley did nothing for me, and feel the one way I can solve my issue is by fixing my poor, toxic inflamed gut and broken body. I should have the answers being an Exercise Professional, but I don't. This is my cry for UID1059."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I'm falling again,UID2840,""I want to vent but if anyone has any suggestions I will accept them too. My depression has slipped again and I am having difficulty with it. I was due to go to New UID3538and in February to catch up with a childhood best friend, tickets payed for and sooo looking forward to it. I was having a lot of trouble with one of my knees, more than normal, an MRI (have had arthritis since my 20s) later and NZ trip cancelled, (did get 75% of tickets refunded) now on waiting list for a knee replacement. I am in constant pain during the day and at night, so not sleeping. Due to medical condition I can't take pain killers or anti-inflammatory. I don't have a car anymore, it died, taking public transport but the extra walking I think is what has aggravated my knee. Consequently my depression has gone down due to pain, and tiredness from not sleeping. When my depression goes down my food consumption goes up and that makes me more UID1183. Saw my psychologist Tuesday and she wants me to take something to UID1059 me sleep, I have always been against sleeping tablets. She also wants me to see a dietician. I am sick of feeling down and having to fight with my depression, I still maintain all my outside activities which I know is vital. My friends don't really get it. I have one friend who tries her hardest but sometimes I just want a hug. I feel teary and I am having to fight the feelings of wanting to give into to it. I am at my volunteer job using their computer to write this. I just feel like shit."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Depression and sensitivity - a connection?,UID786,""I'm asking you. How many of you have depression but it isnt triggered by your sensitivity? Or is triggered by sensitivity.? My depressive cycle has gone from 10 straight days (approx) every 8 weeks to a few hours now and then say every 3 weeks. Improvement has come from correct diagnosis and medication. However regardless of this change my sensitivity has been the common ground all my life. There has always been a trigger. What is the trigger in my case? Hurtful comments. These can come in the form of eg - people saying accusing me of one or more of the following- being childish, thick minded (not getting what other perceive as obvious), being a little manic, saying the inappropriate thing, acting withdrawn, etc At all times I've discovered through self observation, my trigger has involved another person or persons comments. And obviously 'UID1518' cant all be wrong. My sensitivity is what has plummeted me into depression and it's so hard to overcome or rather its so uncomfortable. So I was thinking, I can take an empty pill bottle and mark on it """"anti-sensitivity pills"""" and put on a mask. Every time there is a gathering and I am hurt by comments I'll blurt out a fake laugh. When other realise I am not being sensitive ie that when their cutting comment doesnt hit home like UID1518 often do....I'll reach into my pocket and pull out that bottle and show them why UID1518 didnt succeed. Such is my anger or contempt. for others that hurt me. I havent tried this but I think I will. I'm fed up. The alternative is hibernation and that hasnt worked only to a degree so I have semi withdrawn from people. Hiding away should not be the answer. How many others have this sensitivity that is so fragile it takes you immediately into the dark place? And do you have a strategy in dealing with it."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I can't control bipolar. Holiday from hell ,UID501,I thought I was strong enough to fight bipolar I went to QLD for a moth to visit family. on the plane was a semi nightmare but a few relaxing pills &amp; vodka on a empty tummy had me breathing in a bag Day 2 I went on a high. Every day I did something. My husband thought I was amazing as I did things I'm normally scared of. Thinking bout it now swimming with tiger sharks what the hell But after the high comes the low. Last week I started to hate leaving the house. I canceled going out. I would just lock myself in the room for hours We went away for a weekend with his family. Well I cracked. I hated it! So loud so talked at!!! Zero organisation and no one listened to me He's family then started talking about Tv Shows with people with Bipolar &amp; laughing about it and how crazy UID1518 are. I went into my room and didn't come out nor eat for 2 days. I just broke down. The day we left I didn't even say buy to them. My husband and I went further up north to our dream holiday. I was an anxious mess. I could only have 3 mouths of food a day &amp; was throwing it up &amp; zero sleep. Every day we where out in the water outside my comfort zone and I was on a low. I just felt myself getting smaller and smaller and the panic attacks started settling in The night before we flew I lost it big time. I was not flying because in my mind we where going to die! My husband rented us out a car to drive from the GBR to VIC. We went the inland way. end of the day in a gas station in central QLD I passed out. I woke back up and the workers called an ambulance. I was in and out of it &amp; had pins and needles to my elbows &amp; couldn't feel my legs &amp; hardly breath. I was rushed to hospital to find out it was a panic attack. A panic attack caused me to pass out The next day my husband took us costal way back to our family. He booked a plane for both of us. got to the airport high of my face and yes started seeing black again. I trained it home. I'm now home &amp; on bed rest. Im completely broken. I feel worthless &amp; like a joke. Im over having to explain my illness. Im over my husband getting texted by his family saying poor him.I know poor him. I hate myself everyday being married to him because of who I am. I offer every week that he can leave me. UID2181 I live with the knowledge his family thinks I make his life a living a hell.

"Where to from here.,UID372,""Hello, I don't know why I am UID3760 or how I got UID3760 but I have been told to talk to someone. I have been swimming around in a sea of regret and loss for some years now dealing with each problem as it came by drinking a little more each time. I have been aware of my consumption of alcohol but my family wasn't and needless to say it all became apparent recently. I don't know how far my issues go back but I do know when things started to get a little pear shaped. 2010 my father passed away from cancer very rapidly. I had been working shift work at a brewery for twenty years at that stage. At the end of 2011 I took a redundancy and had a knee replacement that I needed and for the next 12 months I recovered and tried to get work which drained most of our redundancy money. I did manage to get a full time job just after that. It didn't pay much but it was money coming in. It also involved heavy lifting and loading and unloading vehicles by hand. I stuck with that job for just over two years and during that time my daughter tried to take her own life which turned our family upside down. After two years my other knee decided that was enough and I had to have surgery on that one too. We decided to sell our house of 14 years on the Gold Coast as we were struggling with repayments and massive credit card debt. We moved to Bribie UID1594nd to be near my mother as she was unwell and wasn't taking good care of herself and took our daughter with us to change the UID1195 she was living in also. It all seemed like a plan to UID1059 everyone. After a while I started my lawnmowing business as I couldn't get a job. My wife managed to get a full time job but she had to drive an hour each way daily. After six months my daughter decided to go back to the Gold Coast where she got a full time job and also after countless visits to the doctors and hospital my mother come good too. We were there fourteen months when I had a heart attack, we decided then to move back to the Gold Coast to be with the rest of the family and try and start again. We have been UID3760 now for six months I have managed to get a part time job at a caravan park and my wife works full time from home. My drinking has slowly escalated over this time to a point where it has cost me and my wife socially. I have a lot of regret for the decisions I made over this time. We are both in our mid 50's have no home have no money other than weekly pays and nothing to show for years of hard work. Alcohol is a great sedative."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Exhausted ,UID372,""I feel like I don't want to do life anymore. I just feel like I've had enough of myself and I just don't want to do it anymore. From the outside I have an amazing life..I am incredibly lucky and I know I am. I have a wonderful husband who seems to still adore me and 2 beautiful children. So why do I still feel like this? Why am I still going through the same thing over and over again? I have tried so many things...Im on medication which UID1059s, I've tried therapy, exercise, eating better..I've even tried exploring my spirituality. What else can I do? I still wake up wanting to go right back to sleep again. I just long for the moment at the end of the day when I can climb into bed and fall asleep. I started a new job about a month ago and leading up to it it was so excited and motivated. I thought Finally I am back working full time since having the children, I will be busy and have a purpose and will feel like a contributing person of society. But to be honest, my job just requires me to sit at my desk all day with really very little to do I am embarrassed to say. I feel so useless..I feel out of place and it makes for a very long and drawn out day. I am struggling with the mundane routine that is getting up, rushing around like crazy trying to get myself and the kids ready before leaving the house, I am always running 10-20 minutes late..drive to school with arguing kids in the back. Drop them off. go to work. do not very much for 7 hours. pick the kids up. bath the kids. cook dinner. clean up. make sure there is clean clothes and lunches for tomorrow. go to bed finally. Alarm goes off and we do it all again until the weekend. then its cleaning the house. washing groceries and we're pretty much back to the beginning. In reality its all so normal and pretty perfect really, I knoe its not as bad as what it feels like at the time and if thats all I have to complain about..how lucky am I?!

"No room for this illness,UID2826,""Hi, I'm prompted to write due to a recent disclosure I made to a friend regarding my illness. Just over three weeks ago I decided to let a friend in on my anguish just by discussions over lunch. My intentions have always been clear, hiding my illness and people pleasing to cover up. Not so long ago I noticed a decline in my mental health and I've made some changes necessary to UID1059 myself. I feel hurt, confused and let down to say the least because I let a friend in on my illness and it has not been received very well. I've always hidden beneath appearances ( not proud of it) when out with people I appear well dressed and my house is always kept well and styled beautifully. I mix in a UID2106rcle of middle class Melbourne women most of which have husbands like mine in well paid careers. I don't know if there is room for my illness? Like it or not, I have it. I revealed my illness because I was telling a friend I need to slow things down for my health. She asked why? I don't know why I let her in on it but I really regret it because I feel she lacked any basic understanding or compassion, horrible experience. Cutting a long story short, I feel this illness and any mental illness not just bipolar, is cruel and misunderstood. The ignorance shown by my friend has left me gutted. This is a woman who not so long ago commended me on my achievements, always came around with her kids for a swim, long BBQ's in summer by the pool offering compliments on my knack of entertaining and cooking. One week after I told her my history and that I've let some of my own care slide, she hops on social media insinuating via different memes etc about my particular illness. Childish, cruel, ignorant behaviour I was not expecting left me feel cold, isolated and confused. I hope she has not shared what I disclosed. Ok, so a bit of a fall out, I'm a grown woman why does this bother me? It bothers me because no one with mental illness should have to hide, it's the worst outcome. How can a person go from being in my life for so long to just treating me like nothing? Thank you for listening.

"Feeling a surge of desperation....,UID2826,""Hello, I wanted to say prior to writing that I feel hesitant in joining up again because sometimes I'm not equipped at handing out advice or guidance to others and so I feel when I post that I could look like the post blurt lady that does not care about anyone else!! I can tell you I do, but rather I am thinking of how my reply might affect the other person to their posts particularly since I feel mental illness is a personal journey affecting people very differently and there is no one size fits all answer to lots of it. That's how I've found my journey, trials, peaks, troughs and self testing different therapies etc. Sometimes I feel even though I've had a long history of illness that I'm hesitant in giving advice so would like to just let the person know I am listening and care! I've been off the forum for a month now due to my own decline. This past week has seen a cognitive shift in my brain leaving me a bit shaky. I've had morbid thoughts again and have not taken care of any of my own therapy apart from herbal remedies for 3 weeks. It has impacted me greatly. I've eaten wrong, been going to bed at 1am and then up at 5:30am, my meditation has been twice weekly instead of every day. Last week my son heard me saying to myself I'm not worthy, he asked me why am I so hard on myself? At the moment I'm trying hard to stock up again on healthy food, yoga, meditation and exercise before I slid down the hill. UID372ecently I was awarded recognition for a family fete I organised for which the school made $10,000. My contribution again toward being a decent human being. After all the years of trying to show my children how functional I am, I've realised finally my brain can't cope and I've put my own family on dicey ground. My son told me I don't need to prove anything, he is older now and I can't hide stressors from him. I'm angry at myself because I can't keep up. I've let everything slide to become what? A volunteer with passion. I'm angry that I can't get the courage to tell people I'm resigning next year because I suffer Bipolar and can't do it. I received compliments for my efforts but those people don't know my inner battle. I hate the way I'm 'planning' my exit speech already instead of just being able to tell them. I mean just for the sake of my family the community can't be told of my mental illness. It's like torture. Sorry for the destructive ramble.

This time we have tried to reduce the other ant-D and a bit slower but still with negative results. I am feeling like a failure, I am so much better than I was a couple of years ago so thought I could cope with the reduction but no it doesn't seem to be working. I go down hill with my depression and my coping abilities suffer too. I don't want to be on meds as UID1518 do affect my liver but I can't seem to cope without them. Any feed back will be appreciated. Anne"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Feeling limited by bipolar disorder,UID501,Does anyone feel limited by their mental disorder? I have bipolar and feel very limited due to it. I find that I always need to be in my head when I'm with people so I act in a normal behaviour so UID1518 don't suspect I'm not well. I find when I'm going on a high or a low I tend to hide myself from people. Well actually on a high I just be friend strangers because I don't care what UID1518 think lol! I find that I'm struggling with work and the hours and that I'm not going to advance in it. I find myself taking lots of toilet breaks so I can breath. I'm worried if I do get a promotion I will snap and the be known as the girl with the mental illness. I find I can't have a hobby or study because I get so board and distracted easily. One day I want to plan events the next day I want to be a doctor. I'm just really over zero stability and having to really be in my head and watch all my steps making sure I'm healthy. I just wish I could live life with out this annoying thing.,depression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Laughed At,UID501,""Does anyone else get really upset about the stigma with mental illness? Ive got Bipolar which the world calls the crazy gene. People use it left right and centre as an insult to payout on people. Like if a girls upset oh that chick is crazy she's bipolar. All the Facebook memes joking about it. """"I hate having bipolar it's fun!"""" Even the movies. I was watching the Intern and the little girl dad is like your friend has so many moods she's bipolar and UID1518 all laugh like a happy family about it! Like it's a nightmare. I'm trying hard to accept it and let people know but once UID1518 hear Bipolar your crazy. The Stigma is set in. Today one of my close friends who knows I have bipolar started liking jokes about it so goodbye loser!"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I just feel numb?,UID372,""Hi, I'm going to be honest I don't know how to go about this because I don't know whats wrong. So i havnt felt right for a while, I've always been happy and smiley and everyone came to me to feel better but lately I don't feel anything. I don't want to see anyone, or even get out of bed. most days I don't even get out of my pj's. I've never felt so off and I'm scared, even writing this all I want to do is cry because I don't know whats going on with me. For the last three months I've been working from home because the company i work for got kicked out of their office. I was put under emmence pressure to get work done that was never used and UID1518 are behind on not only my pay but my super and my course fees (tafe course) I think because I'm always at home it's putting stress on all of my relationships, especially my family. All these things are building up and getting to me, I feel like i have no one in my life which is ridiculous because I know I do! The idea of looking for a new job terrifies me! Ive managed to get a few resumes out but it gives me anxiety just thinking about it. Look I don't really know what I'm hoping to get from posting this, I think I just needed to get it all off my chest and maybe I'll feel better? However if anyone has any ideas on how I can shake this feeling I would be very grateful because I hate this version of me....I want to be the other me...the happy me!

"More sharing of mental health ,UID2826,""When I had extreme mania, my state of mind reached another level. The experience of euphoria still leaves me stunned to this day. My mind was unhealthy but the extreme state was so clear, it bought such clarity, I thought I had everything figured out with precision. I'm lucky that I stayed safe, my turmoil stretched to ideas that were so illogical but I believed them. I've never had extreme mania again, I get hypo mania and can manage it, its not as extreme yet still difficult. After this experience I found myself wanting to explore it with the psychiatrist over and again. I also saw the psychologist once a week just to tell her my inner thoughts, share and off load. I started to feel once the down came I became very rigid, very fixed along with new symptoms. I could not seem to or have the energy for grooming myself. I remember yelling in fury at myself in the mirror and just how desperate that state of being was, how the illness ripped at my being. I viewed myself unworthy, someone needing punishment and wondered if other people suffered to. This forum is a wonderful place for people to off load, even if UID1518 feel compelled to share because mental health is isolating. When I was at my worst I looked like any other middle class woman in Melbourne and I still do. It makes me think, we pass people in our travels and never know their struggles if any. Society places stereotypes on certain mental illness through media etc but until you've gone through the illness it will never be exactly how UID1518 depict it. People can experience the illness differently as well. One of my main reasons for not opening up to people in my UID2106rcles is because of threats to my immediate sense of dignity. Call me a pessimist but I do feel people label once UID1518 have knowledge of something. That's a shame because I know that there are lots of kind people out there but the risk to self and family is too great. Bipolar in media often gets shown as violent people, I know I'm not violent. My struggle is inner. I am aware of the desperation of the illness though. I remember searching shelves and book shops trying to identify with other peoples stories, support group seemed to hard, but I yearned to listen to others. I've come a long way in terms of putting myself out there so to speak. 5 years ago I would never have shared any of my journey on a board like this. Thank you for listening."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"The illness at it's worst. My memory,UID2826,""I describe my heaviest time, the time when my illness was most severe. A time when full blown mania struck and lifted me to euphoria, a state in which I felt like I was touching clouds. An activation is how I remember, my senses reaching a level like never before. At the same time there was a fierceness to my being that is hard to accept. Suddenly, out of no where I feel forced by something, compelled to accomplish things in an absurd style, like an urgency but I don't understand who or what is pushing this urgency. Mental illness is pushing me, Manic depressive, Bipolar. I welcome guests into my home and entertain with a new baby on very little sleep, charged up and ready, ready for what though? At the time I never asked myself this, it was like my state wasn't apparent. I somehow know though to 'cover up' to people how little sleep I'm having with a new baby, cover up that I've been up most of the night inbetween feeds sorting out what I know later as unnecessary items in the fridge, cupboards, ferociously running about in a state. My euphoria keeps me feeling looked after, like the energy provides a wholesome state of being, it's beautiful in a sense. Little do I know the drop down from this height will be the biggest drop I've ever experienced. I awake with feelings saturating me, feelings of absolute guilt. Guilt in extreme that I deserve punishment, I'm caught in my own brain and no one around me see's it. They see a new mum coping with a well looked after bub, impeccable house and clean washing. UID794 knows this mum is a tortured soul underneath. I go into the back yard and sit in the winter sun. I'm unable to wan't guests anymore, the once excited entertainer has lost her capability. I just want my baby boy and I and try will all my might to keep up appearances when people still visit. I'm compelled to wear the same pants, the same shirt, it's like the illness wont let me change them for days on end, something takes away my personal appearance. But as time goes by the clothing becomes a habit, some force keeps me. I have no energy, lethargy is like no other time in my life. I've become homebound, exhausted and trapped venturing out only to health visits. One day I decide to make the easiest dish, spaghetti for my husband and I. For some reason my brain can't cope. I cant put it together. Depressive side has won. My mind starts giving messages that I'm linked to fraud somehow. I start calling lawyers. This illness, cruel."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Lack of energy,UID372,Hi everyone I'm new UID3760. I've being dealing with my anxiety and depression for the past few months. Addressing it for the first time. In retrospect I've struggled with this my whole life. It's hard to accept as I'm social and make people laugh a lot and always have felt pretty happy? And yet there is this thing underneath it all. I have always had anxiety attacks and low times UID3760 and there. For the first time however it's been really hard to pick myself up. I'm so tired. I physically feel like even sitting is hard. I can't stand it. I saw a doctor and am on a low dose anti depressant . I've being on UID3237 for six years and now I'm up to 30mg. I was fine on UID3237 but now it is upped I don't feel better. Actually I feel worse. I'm trying to exercise. I'm trying to study. I'm trying to meditate and think positive thoughts. I'm a practicing artist and I can't create much work. Everything feels hard and nothing interests me. I don't want to burden my husband as we lost his dad to cancer 8 months ago and he hasn't being the best himself. He knows I'm sad and is supportive. I feel like I can't take care of him. It's an effort to do the laundry and clean the house. I'm about to do a prac with university and am so scared I will have no energy. Any advice? I feel so useless.,depression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"taking a look at myself again..,UID2826,""Hi, thank you for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate it. I'm feeling disappointed in myself due to self growth pursuits almost testing me. Over the past two years I've taken on two positions voluntarily within one of my children's school and their sports club being Secretary and President. Life is a balancing act, I never stop thinking about how others live, how UID1518 keep up with everything. Life is incredibly busy between extra curricular activities, playing taxi UID3760 and there for the kids, housework, shopping, volunteering, supporting extended family, class room UID1059 etc etc. I should be able to cope right? I mean, it's life. Well I've noticed just like the throws of this illness, that at certain points I cope better than others. I continue to self evaluate what I achieve mainly to see how far I've come dealing with this illness. I've got a large task ahead which I'm organising right now, I'm leading the event just like last year a fete/fun day. It's an enormous job for which I'm responsible for and I'm feeling a little jittery fitting it all in. The benefits of this are that I'm constantly keeping in contact with people, I'm not shut off in any sense but my mind is over stimulated by it all right now. I'm caught between loyalty and my own self awareness in looking out for myself. My husband believes if I take a role next year that I should accept to step down and be a general UID1059er instead of leading the events. He thinks I'm capable but if the stress peaks then why do it to myself. Part of me resents my line of thinking, that I need to prove to the family that I can function at top level. I see myself as a fraction of the women I once was when I worked in a corporate setting. My husband tells me I have nothing to prove. He is inclined to push my creative side, I make jewellery mostly. I've got to the point that I wan't to just accept that I'm getting older now and since a full fleged onset of the illness came on its changed things. Even though my illness was there when I was working cbd as accountant, our lives were different then so I coped with it differently and only had myself and husband to look after. In short, I'm sick of putting pressure on myself to prove to my family. I try to achieve at a higher level and obviously it brings too much stress. When will I ever find the right balance? Or is it that I've pressured myself because of fear that I'm a hopeless bipolar?"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I'm completely lost in life,UID1277,""I don't know where to go or what to say or what to do anymore, i'm completely lost.

Two days after I felt myself starting to slide I began a reduction in meds, again, but this time a lot slower and the other anti-D. I am eating more and feeling lazy again, I did make myself go to the movies using public transport, (car died) and saw the new Ghostbusters, it was good. I thought i was on the up and up and because I was feeling good I thought I had turned that corner, but no. Is this my life now, and rollercoaster ride.

"My expression as such,UID2826,""I thought I'd share some feelings sorrounding some of my experience. For a long time these experiences have been hidden, in shame because in my experience that's what this illness makes a person feel whether it's wanted or not. I've tried hard to lift those unwanted secondary feelings to the actual illness over a period of 10 years because I feel my illness has served enough. Unfortunately I'm still not there, the process of lifting those feelings which are nothing but destroying, UID1518 don't change a thing, the illness is in varying forms a part of who I am today and have been all along. So I have learned to try and fiercely rid myself of any extra burdens along my journey, I'm a work in progress. Full acceptance of having manic depression has not knocked on my door yet, I'll get there. At my worst, the depressive side enveloped me so bad that I struggled to 'feel', everything beautiful around me seemed like a chore in attaining, I asked the question why can't I get some nourishment? Well depression at its worst (in my own experience) felt like that, a never ending struggle to get filled up. Admittedly I faked some smiles just so I didnt have to have others in my life ask what is wrong. Depression keeps a person under, it can destroy and suppress that you search so hard for enjoyment. It is a cruel illness. In short, when i experienced my worst I thought no one would ever understand, I mean I would struggle to get through the day, wishing it would be over, the dread so extreme. It was not something I could share, so the illness gripped me until it subsided. We are deserving of peace, we are people like any other with illness."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Intense self hatred,UID2161,""I don't know what is wrong with me. I have an intense self hatred and at times it spills over into hating everything around me including people at times.

I have given up on trying to find a girlfriend, I don't find myself appealing and think I am not good looking. I have stopped performing my music at open mic as I feel like I am making a fool of myself. I have stopped looking for a job. I have lost all self belief.

She keeps telling me I bring her and my dad shame and have been bringing them down due to being unemployed and wants me to keep it secret from their friends and relatives.

"I am a successful professional failure,UID799,""Hello BB I am a 32yo female, a qualified health professional, in a wonderful secure relationship. I live in a nice house, drive a nice car, make good money &amp"; have good relationships with family &amp; a handful of close friends. I generally have good physical health, I really have nothing to complain about. BUT....... That is the exact problem, despite all this I feel like a failure. I feel like I am not good enough, I feel like I'm a useless burden to everyone. I have battled depression since I was a child, my parents first sought UID1059 for me when I was about 9 or 10, & I have seen various professionals since. It wasn't until a few years ago that I accepted depression was with me for life, & was something I would need to tackle EVERYDAY for the rest of my life. I've been medicated on & off for years, but I useto take myself off it as I knew how to do it safely, I have been pretty good for the last 2 years I stuck to my meds & had regular CBT with a psychologist who I really clicked with. I built good support networks, opened up about my depression & even weathered a few 'storms' (difficult times that could potentially unravel me). The issue is that the negative self talk is winning the battle at the moment, I've had a few challenges lately, but nothing severe, and nothing that should have been so unraveling to my mental health, which only adds to the feelings of failure, 'why am I so emotionally usless?' Is a question that runs around my head frequently. I started a new job & am finding it difficult, because even tho it's in the same field, it's a new skill set & I am not feeling confident at all! My partner is overseas for work at the moment, he is a UID3004 part of my support network & I guess I underestimated the effect his absence would have on me. I started the downward spiral about 6 weeks ago, I hit rock bottom last week, I have had to take a few weeks off work, am changing medications (having awful withdrawl at the moment) & need to find a new psychologist because the one I saw previously has stopped practicing due to her own poor health (this makes me so sad, she is young with 2 small children and a beautiful soul). I guess I don't really need advice, I've been on the 'merry go round' for years &amp; have started the process of getting better yet again. I am just a bit lonely &amp; edgy at the moment, I' m alone at home &amp; I guess I want to hear from people who understand what it's like to face the internal challenges again, &amp; again, &amp;" again.

"How natural is depression?,UID786,""style=""""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt";"> Why does mental illness exist? One answer could be it is a form of natural selection. All animals evolve. But I wonder sometimes if our ills or parts of them might not have come from our traumatised childhood caused by bad people or genetics. One theory was that man used to protect his family from other people or predators. While stirring his broth, if he was more alert that what was a common level of alertness, he would be more likely to be aware of another caveman sneaking up behind him to steal his stew or hurt his family. This ultra alert frame of mind developed into ADHD as we know it. Depression with its very high percentage of people suffering it, has eluded the medical profession. However one could argue- in the many hundreds of thousands of years that man has roamed the earth, stress of modern life, diets including soft drinks and high sugar, lack of bonding of people within communities and the almighty dollar that forces us to perform more than ever before, has evolved only within the last few generations…the computer a major contributor only in the last generation alone!! Yet we hop onto that computer train or be left behind. Stress can be a major contributor. Stress- meaning- “a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding UID2106rcumstances.” Which in my language, how I feel about it is burnout from taking on activities in excess of what I can cope with. Is that natural? I think it is. We are born with limits…we cant all cope with life. We have our limits and then that's it! Some have high limits, some not so high. Narcissists is another example. The need for power over others might have developed within small towns where no one led the people. An opportunist would rise up and in the early days conquer all challengers. Saddam Hussain did this to any rival at all during his reign as did other tyrants. It wasn’t and isn’t acceptable but is it natural? In a world where the strongest survive – yes it must be as it has happened from the beginning of time. And so when suffering depression, blame should never be levelled in the sufferers direction. Therefore you should not experience guilt either for guilt comes from blame. Tell that to some! One can justifiably be at fault when you know you have an illness and you are in denial or you abandon treatment/medication when diagnosis has been confirmed. For then others around you suffer also. That isn’t natural, its inconsiderate. It's a choice UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Partially this is because I can't be bothered talking about it, but sometimes it is partially because I feel pressure to get better, like I know UID1518 want me to get better and when I'm not, I guess I don't like admitting it. It's not so much the stigma that prevents me from being honest, as my hubby and friends are very understanding and don't make me feel ashamed for it.

"Clear the road- I’m on my way,UID786,""style=""""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt";"> UID372ecently I wrote two articles that at the time I didn’t know UID1518 would be a sequel. “The snowball effect” was about how energy in a forum like this can gather strength and accelerate in its positivity. The second one was “Do we expect a smooth road in life” depicts our basic expectations of a life free of any mental illness. We all have a journey whether we know it or not, recognise it or not. That journey, a road of twists and turns “Y” intersections or multiple intersections- can be a fragile one. One major slip in our decision making or an unsuspecting thump from a runaway vehicle (depression truck) and we fall flat on our faces. Let me digress UID3760. Kathy Watt Australia’s gold medallist in cycling was asked after her race how she won it. Her reply- “my coach told me to get to the front and just as I start to feel comfortable…add another 10% effort…then just as I relax a little…add another 10%. These 10% added effort you don’t think is there but it is. UID794 could catch me.” We often refer to situations with our struggles as if we are on the bottom of our challenges and often we are. But there are days, hours, that we feel better. During these times, we are at an intersection, to the left is “go back to bed” and to the right is “don’t go back to bed”. We all know how hard that is but that snowball of recovery even short term recovery like a few hours wont happen if we take the easier route and turn left! By turning right we might- take the garbage out and during that short time you might realise how warm and inviting the sun is, UID3584t the mail delivery person, see a daisy flower in bloom, realise your dog is staring at you for a walk lead in mouth…so that snowball has commenced all because you turned right.. As that snowball gathers momentum with each right turn your journey is no longer a plodding walk but turns into a brisk walk. You begin to get the feeling you are beating the black dog. If and when you think you are at this point then your choices are so important. There is a fighter inside us so much so some of us have never seen it. If those that think UID1518 haven't got a fighter inside them then what would you do if a dog bit you and held on? You'd find the fighter So that choice in your journey comes when you approach that new intersection. Left is """"back 3 spaces"""" and right is """"I'm going to fight like hell"""". Turn right on recovery road and do your best..then keep adding 10%. The black dog wont catch you!... UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Been fighting this depression tooth and nail and I am still back sliding, and with this back sliding there is a HUGE amount of anger though I am not totally sure if the anger is aimed at me or at the cause of my depression sliding. You see a little over a year ago I got really stupid, my wife's nephew and his wife got kicked out of the place UID1518 were living, mostly for having to many animals and lieing about it, so after talking with the wife I told the kids (UID1518 are both 40..my age..but yet myself and wife call them the kids because that is how we see them as 4 yearolds on a good day!) that UID1518 could move in for a SHORT while, so UID1518 brought all their crap, and 4 dogs with them (so I now have 5 dogs on my properity and in my home) then we find out that the newphew's wife is end stage kidney failure, which does have some bareing on my situation, on top of them being kicked out of the place UID1518 were renting UID1518 owe the government a bit of money for defrauding the government and had a lot of other bills, which my wife and I payed most of their bills off..to date UID1518 have cost us over 45 grand easily, the nephew in law is an ungreatful SOB always whining and moaning about this or that and not even offering to do the dishes, heck UID1518 both have not even changed their bed sheets since UID1518 got UID3760 the wife and I (both of us being disabled) have to do it for them. And of course the nephew's wife has a lot of problems but yet she is not ungreatful, where as the nephew realy is ungreatful. Anyways as UID1518 do not pay ANY bills (other then one of their own storeage bills) I want to charge them rent 400 a month, that """"rent"""" money is actually away to get them a bond saved up as the nephew spends all his money (he is on the dole and has a part time """"job"""" on stupid little toys(expensive ones) and what not, but my wife is not wanting to listen to me on the rent issue as """"UID1518 are family and no one understands the nephew like I do."""" Doesn't not UID1059 that my wife is going though menopause and can be a real nasty piece of work to ME, everyone else she is very happy and friendly but as soon as something goes wrong I am the one she snaps at.

When determination & motivation become a problem by interfering with self care,UID1321,I was doing well for a while. After motivating sessions with psychologist & psychiatrist and life stresses easing somewhat I set some goals and started working towards them. I kept a daily record of how I was going with each of the different goals and this proved useful by focusing on what I had achieved rather than what I hadn't done. I had a couple of bad nights sleep one due to my husband being unwell but still kept myself going. Unfortunately I remained tired and was unable to sleep in to catch up. My problem now is that I am in the middle of a project at home which is taking longer than expected partly because pushing myself to work when tired has led to mistakes and inefficiency. I either push myself as I did last night and then when I stop I can't relax which then stops me sleeping creating ongoing problems or I give in and rest but then I keep noticing all the stuff needing doing so can't get the rest I needed. I have had long term problems with pushing myself too hard and not caring for myself. If I am not being productive I feel worthless which makes my depression worse but fatigue is also a UID3004 trigger for depression. This pushing myself has been a pattern since a traumatic event as a child which left me feeling guilty for doing nothing to UID1059 so feeling useless is a trigger for very negative self talk. Does anyone else have problems balancing being motivated & productive & carrying out more relaxing activities / self care to remain well,depression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Enough of depression -im moving,UID372,""I have lived with depression for probably most of my life. At school i had difficulties with bullying and social exclusion and these issues have seemed to follow me into adulthood employment and friendships. Had an ex wife who treated me poorly during our marriage and then turned nasty when the gravy train ended. Into my fifties, i have decided enough is enough. I feel totally invisible to my social network - UID1518 either totally ignore me or only want to know me when there is some sort of gain or advantage for them. Or UID1518 only want to know me to tell me their problems because im a good listener. But no one really knows how i feel or cares. Around the time of my last birthday, i made the decision that i have had enough of feeling UID1183 because people treat me poorly and that im going to move interstate to try something new. Things cant be any different where im going so i feel i may as well give it a try. So sick of excuses of people being busy in their lives or UID1518 didnt mean not to include you in a group invite and not to take it personally. So tired of employment rejection. So tired of family members taking me for granted and only wanting to know me when UID1518 can get some sort of financial benefit. So bye everyone. They say you shouldnt burn bridges but most bridges start from opposite sides of the river and UID3584t in the middle. No bridge is built in one direction all the time. So not really burning any bridges. I have cut my ties with everyone - but no one has even really noticed. Because no one actually gives a damn. So bye bye farewell.

"List of triggers for depression ,UID3332,""Hi all After 2 years of being on the forums I have noticed several major things- 1) depression can affect anyone 2) however more often than not there is a trigger preceding it ie family, financial, work, health & other indicators 3) many people struggle with the diagnosis initially 4) some have a predisposition to depression 5) some have depression due to external factors, others may be genetically disposed, others may suffer seemingly """"out of nowhere"""". From my own humble understanding & making generalisations, it would appear most often that preceding events contribute greatly to depression. This includes grief, low confidence, high self expectations which cause us to feel badly about ourselves if we don't UID3584t our expectations, life events & situations that distress us. Poor confidence, a tendency to isolate ourselves & guilt about accepting we have an illness all contribute to our poor self esteem. We are our own worst critics. We internalise our negative sense of self. We struggle with accepting our diagnosis-often thinking it is a negative reflection of our selves. Thats just a few observations. In understanding & accepting ourselves others may have ideas. After all we each battle to understand & live with our illness. please add your thoughts.

You have all had different lives with different backgrounds. You sit there wondering what to say. One person begins to ramble on about nothing in particular…not making much sense hence no replies are given. One young woman begins to cry. She becomes visibly distraught and at that point some of the others begin to comfort her. As she calms she mentions why she got upset and others begin to reply ….the snowball of interaction has begun to grow. The conversations extend to nearly all, some prefer to keep quiet but UID1518 are at least- listening. We’ve often mentioned in this forum the need to get the “mix” right. The mix being proper diagnosis, the correct medications and the right doses, a calmer UID1195, a more suitable career, better working hours, a shield against the cruel and toxic and professional ongoing treatment. This forum could be said to be in that “mix”. Why? Because not only can some ask questions and get a reply quickly but you are contributing to the gathering of this little community with the same ambitions, to UID1059 each other find ways to cope. I would suggest however, that your participation to give to others comfort in few words with a reply is not only UID1059ing them….it is a tonic for YOU. Since being on this forum I’ve found it an important part of my own therapy. Giving to others in the form of referring to your own life’s struggles, your childhood or your genes can be such a relief for those searching for answers.

"Depression- your plan for 2016,UID786,""As I write this, its xmas morning. Last xmas morning I made a vow to myself....that by next xmas morning (today) I would have advanced with my depression and made a few improvements. I would have- 1/ not thought at all in the twelve months...of suicide as a possibility. That that avenue, the idea of it, upon entering my thoughts, I would discount it 2/ That I would seek better stability of my medication. This was achieved by April by regular consultation with my doctor as to adjusting my mood stabilisers and anti depressants. This involved a little tweaking and was easier than I thought. I'm now as stable as I have ever been and likely ever will be. We need to allow for the fact that meds wont ever make us totally stable and we should seek the next best level. 3/ That on a personal level I would accept my wife more for her quirkiness and show more appreciation for her care and consideration. 4/ That I would seek more time aside for my time in a nearby forest. To take along my music I love (the pan flute) and play it. Meditate. 5/ That I would staunchly protect myself and my mental health by not allowing toxic people to enter my life nor allow some to re-enter it after previously being shut out. Torturing myself with troublemakers isn't going to UID1059 me. 6/ That I would remain on this forum. To try to connect with those needing my opinion in their struggle to get through life.

"The smallest of triggers - it doesn't take much ,UID2161,""I am so sensitive that my feelings get hurt so easily and that sets me into a pattern of thinking (you are so stupid, no wonder noone likes you, I don't know why people want to be friends with me, I should just disappear). The smallest triggers set me into a downward spiral. I was feeling great the last few days as I decided on which course I want to study in uni and applied. My best friend made a reply to a Facebook comment I made, he was joking around but it made me feel stupid. Sometimes the comments I leave I do not realise others see as silly, I do not meant to comes across like a fool, it makes me think I am a fool. In my head last night I kept saying to myself """"he's only joking"""" """"he's doing what close guy friends do and give each other s**t"""" """"my gosh you are so sensitive"""" """"you know he loves and cares about you as he has told you numerous times"""", but my emotions are of hating myself for appearing to be so stupid for the sometimes inane, pointless comments I leave on Facebook and kind of angry at my friend for making me feel stupid by pointing that out to me a number of times. I am aware he was joking around and that his reply in no way is meant to hurt me and shouldn't hurt me but it's like my emotions make me hate myself and get angry at him and want to disappear from any online presence. My friend has told me that is what is so endearing about me, my dagginess and some of the things I say sometimes which sound silly. But I feel unintelligent. Sometimes my mouth moves faster than my mind and I say dumb things. I can't understand why I react like this to something so trivial and harmless. I know there is no need to feel this way and try to get myself together but some force inside of me pulls me down and washes over me. I was feeling upbeat and positive about my future (going back to uni if I get accepted and hopefully into the career I want) and now I feel like I have no hope and don't feel motivated to do anything and am filled with a sadness. Anyone UID3760 react like I do? I wish I wasn't so easily hurt and had thick skin.

UID372egularly we try to educate them by saying good management of their condition is a preferable approach rather than a 100% fix. I mention this because if we admit to our ambition of good management then we resign to the fact that we will never have a full recovery. That being said does that mean we will never find true happiness? Will we always reflect upon not getting to full recovery and so never really be happy? I'm asking this UID3760 today because I have finally found happiness yet still have my down and up days depending on my mania/moods. I'm happy even though I'm fragile emotionally and I'm happy besides the fact that humans upset me regularly. Why is this so and could there be tip I can give you? Briefly- I have bipolar 2, dysthymia, depression and previously had anxiety with panic attacks. I'm on mood stabilisers and a small amount of anti depressants, fish oil. Physical issues include sleep apnea and deep vein thrombosis. My wife has depression. Unlike me she sleeps a lot when the black dog visits.

"My Story,UID1277,""Hi, Depression, I first felt UID1183 in my late primary school years being picked on and called names certainly didn't UID1059, As the months and years went on my depression became worse through high school where more bullying was happening on a daily basis. I thought I had good friends but I found that when I left high school I realised UID1518 weren't friends at all, I was in such a deep dark hole. I became very isolated when I left school no social life or friends when all the while I knew and felt I was becoming more UID1183, this was compounded by not telling anyone about my depression and about the bullying as I had lost all faith in teachers looking out for students like myself UID1518 didn't stop the bullying in fact it got worse if the students knew I told on them. I did so many courses in the immediate years leaving school in the hope of getting a job, nothing came up even though I completed so many courses this just crushed me inside I so desperate to get a job. It was in 2005 when a medical condition I have had to be operated on as I was legally blind at the time of surgery, everything seemed so dark and so hard with my depression getting worse with each month, the unemployment at the time becoming a real issue and recovering from a transplant to save my sight, I was in a hole. My first real opportunity came in 2007 where I started work at a local fast food franchise, initially it was such a good feeling to be able to work and to feel like I was contributing in some way. While at McDonalds the UID1195 changed and I felt my depression was coming back it did in a big way, in 2012 I left McDonalds I had to leave. I left at the start of 2012 during this time I enrolled in an automotive course while looking for work. In 2013 little did I know this was the year where my depression would come to ahead, it did in August having spent almost 2 years unemployed. It was at this point that I was able to speak to someone and finally tell how I was feeling, I never told anyone I had depression for 14-15 I kept this dark secret to myself. As I am describing how I am feeling I am waiting to go to hospital my first visit. I stay in hospital for a week or so it was horrible, I come back home only to find I cannot stop crying I needed to find support services and groups. I quickly found some support services and groups who UID1059 and assist people like myself. I became involved in there programs and groups without knowing how much UID1518 would UID1059 me, UID1518 UID1059ed me a great deal thinking about it now. In 2014 I was still not a 100% my depression was still evident and I still had a drive to work but I needed to UID1059 myself first so I could work. In March I had my 2nd hospital admission this time at more suitable better UID1195 hospital I knew each time before during and after a hospital visit I was making progress, later in the year I had my 3rd and final hospital visit which UID1059ed me just that bit more. Not long after being out from hospital I grabbed an opportunity without knowing how much it would UID1059 me it got me back into work and it was that decision that one last bit of hope that has turned out to be one of my best decisions ever. I grabbed at the chance to get back into the workforce and I haven't looked back since. This year I have made so much progress that I would never had though about making. I hope to anyone who reads this gets inspired to keep on going because just when you feel like giving up it can take just that one chance one opportunity to turn your life around and make some serious progress. Always cling onto hope never let it go and always seek UID1059 and support when you feel you need too. Take care all "",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Does it ever get better,UID372,""First time trying anything like this, ive tried psychs, UID1518 didnt UID1059 cause i would hide to much, and i have the mentality, if you cant spot it, you dont deserve to know, stupid, i know. Pretty much i got depression a year or two ago, i dont know, i wouldn't acknowledge it, cause i was always happy an optimistic, nothing could bring me down, then i got sick with glandular fever, and it all started going down hill, i lost my health, i lost my job from that, and it eventually lead to me loosing my fiancee, took about another 6 months after all that to acknowledge i had anything wrong, i was down , didnt want to do anything, but a friend eventually got through to me, currently trying diffrent medications, and nothing seams to work, when i feel like things might be starting to get better, i just get kicked back to the ground and it feels like im starting all over again, the worst thing is i dont have my family as support, 'just do something blah blah blah, UID1518 might think it UID1059s but it dosnt. i just constantly feel like shit and it just feels like everything is always getting worse, i just want to genuienly smile, and get excited for something again, anything. /sigh"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You will have bouts of depression, it will always be like this. I felt like someone had slapped me. I have been told this before but it sank in UID1861. Both my psychiatrist and my psychologist have said I have depression for life but I always thought I would beat it. Isn't that why I am in therapy. I feel like all hope is lost, I do my best well actually I try really hard to put into practice what my therapist say to do, and i was told UID1861 I have worked extremely hard with the psychologist this year but that felt like a waste of time.

I'm just trying a new medicine these last 4 days and finding my anxiety is less but now I'm feeling very UID1183 and down. Maybe because of the weather, or cause my mate (who is always up for a good yarn) had an off day, or cause I'm not really comfortable with my GP, not sure the reason why I'm so down. Normally i suffer from anxiety mostly with a bit of depression, now its quite a lot of depression. I did UID3584t my support worker today and we had a good chat for an hour and a half but the rest of the day I just felt really down. My family does all the unhelpful things like avoiding me when i need to feel people around me and say things like """"keep busy"""" which doesnt UID1059. I guess other people have or are going through something similar and I know it can take several weeks for a medication to work also but would be interesting to hear if others are going through this and what strategies UID1518 use (I have some already, the weather really fouled up everything today but that's another story)."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Thoughts on common symptoms of depression,UID3332,""Dear friends, I've been around this forum for over 2 yrs now & I've noticed a thought pattern similar to each person experiencing depression. I'm going to generalize so please don't take these symptoms as common to all of us. Nor am I medically trained. Just thoughts from me as a forum regular. I've noticed many of us- -Have high self expectations &/or perfectionism -often feel like a failure with low self esteem, lack of confidence -highly sensitive & fear criticism -struggle with diagnosis & treatment options whilst feeling """"weak"""" as a person for having this illness -often isolate ourselves as we feel Noone could understand -experience anxiety as a precursor or as part of their depression -fear other people's reactions at a time we are highly vulnerable -blame ourselves for not being able to """"get on with it"""" - set ourselves unrealistic high self expectations about what we """"should do"""" despite our illness requiring us to slow down & let go of some pressures or triggers -feel unable to talk openly to those close to us -feel alone & isolated - have personal stigma ie struggle to accept depression as an illness -fear things will never improve -need a sense of hope & the ability to limit thinking to short term as we often fear & generalize about things that may never happen -can lack insight when very low & experiencing suicidal thoughts. It's not our lives we want to destroy but rather the pain & thoughts we are experiencing -struggle with doing things that would usually be simple tasks -feel the fight/flight response heightened -want to be supported but feel too vulnerable so stay isolated. May fear going out or doing daily tasks -wear a """"mask"""" when around others -generally feel exhausted, lacking hope &amp";" battles to get through each day. One other common thread amongst the stories on UID3760 is that many if not most people have experienced some forms of a traumatic, upsetting or certain life situation that could be seen as a precursor to depression. I'm sure there's other common symtoms the ones above are just straight from my thoughts without any research etc- thoughts I feel common on the forum. So if you relate to any your not alone.

I have been working off and on with a psychiatrist for 20+ and at the begining of the year I agreed to work with a psychologist as well. My shrink and i felt I was stuck and no matter what we did nothing would shift it. So I have been seeing this psychologist every fortnight and touching base with my shrink every other fortinght. We all felt I was making progress with the different apporach that the psychologist has taken. I spent 10 days last month interstate staying with a cousin and had a terrific time came back about a week ago and have sunk to new lows. Why what went wrong. My shrink said people often are down after a holiday but I am more than down, back to old thought patterns, feel teary and lost. Dissappointed that I have gone back down agian. Yes I have a lot on my plate but that doesn't explain it. I had a lot on my plate before when I was feeling better. Does it ever end.

"I'll call it Anxietession because I've got no idea what's going on,UID1664,""I've been training at work as if I am joining their department so I can do time-in-motion studies and process efficiency studies. Tuesday night I didn't sleep well I was going on the phones UID3550. UID3550 morning arrives and I feel like I'm coming down with the flu. No energy and a bit anxious. I got half way to work on the train and messaged my boss (who is really really supportive) that I couldn't make it. I got home drank 3 glasses of sports drink as I thought I might be dehydrated (one of the meds I take makes it easy to dehydrate). For the last 3 days I've felt hopeless, uninspired, still bored with life and generally horrible. I've had depression for 20 years, probably longer. The root cause has been my father leaving when I was 4. There are some other family traits that contribute and also genetic predisposition. I see a psychiatrist every week and have done for the past 4 years I feel like progress has slowed and I spend the time staring out the window in his office. Expensive view. I was dating a guy for about 2 months, he seemed to be just perfect! Even said he loves me. Then I got anxiety about the relationship and that had me in bed for a week. Then I got depression and that had me in bed for another week. The guy was good about it and understood - he said- as he had suffered depression as well - he even wrote and published a book about it. Anyway, he decides that he doesn't want to continue pursuing a relationship because it's not fun. He just wants it to be fun. UID372ide our motorbikes, and watch telly and go out and all the fun things. I guess that I have an illness isn't fun for him.

"Depression the great Lie or Change Your Truth,UID3067,""I have suffered from depression for the last 15 years, to the point of me losing control and trying to commit suicide. As I have slowly rebuilt myself, and learned more about this great lie. Depression is a great lie because it based on lies that we tell ourselves. I am fat, I am worthless, I have no friends, my family hates me, I am not worth loving. These are just some of the great lies that we tell ourselves, and we believe these lies because our emotions are running our head not the logical side of us. All of these things and more are going on in our minds . What does """"Change your truth."""" mean? You see we each hold our own truth, what may be true for one person may not be true for another person. With depression the key to winning this war, even the small battles with it, which turn into great victories if we allow, is to change our own truth about ourselves. You see all those lies that I mentioned before, a lot of them have a grain of truth in it, that is why we start to believe all of these negative emotions that we have. It gets so bad that we overwhelm ourselves, and can not see the honest truth. Logic is the key to fighting depression and UID3760 is how Change Your Truth, comes in to effect. What we need to do is take, one of the negative thoughts about ourselves, lets say you keep seeing yourself as fat because of the weight you have put on...the truth of the matter is sure you may have put on 5 or 6 pounds, but when you look into the mirror you do not see these 5 or 6 pounds what you see when you look at yourself is this false image of a person that looks like a blimp. Yet the reality is that you are not a blimp but our minds do not let us see the truth.So what do we do? We Change our Truth, this is a hard thing to do, but once you start with ONE negative thought, and truly look at it with logic, not with emotions, you find that grain of truth and you CHANGE it...so you have gained a little weight, get up and go for a walk, go outside and watch your kids or pets play and get a little active. I am not talking about running a marathon, even if its just going down the front steps and walking to the end of your drive away and back, do that every day for a week, then next week, go beyond your drive way and go a little farther each week.

I went on meds and UID1518 made a small difference. I took a month or so off work and got myself together again through exercise and mindfulness. Am off them now and no panic attacks. But I do have physiological symptoms of anxiety all day...no spiralling,crippling worries and negativity just the underlying physical / mental symptoms - heart palpitations numbness mild dissociation mind racing ahead. Nothing triggers it - no reason behind it. I can't focus and I wake very often at 3am with this insane feeling...it goes on and on. I get no sleep and I am lost in a racing mind unable even to read, listen to music plan, the day properly or relax. My husband can't understand me and is angry at me for not showing affection and not connecting with him. He often says he can't cope anymore because I don't smile and show him any love and is on the verge of leaving. Fair enough. I tend to get angry but then I blame myself.

As a result I'm not good at affection and openly expressing my love) I hold everything back from him around how I am feeling because I fear the conflict and what it will do to me emotionally. I really hate myself at the moment. I blame myself for relationship problems, I feel like a failure because of my anxiety, think im stupid and worthless with no talent at all, I hate that I can't get my act together and blame myself for all the problems we have with our children - their learning and development (youngest son is bombing in school we are not sure what's wrong with him) .

Hospitalized from this time onwards for approx 9 months of intensive chemo & bone marrow transplant. Not a good outlook but somehow do I stop my mind thinking of the terrible journey ahead. Telling the kids was so hard. I feel broken in pieces. Try to be managing in front of him but sit up & cry all night thinking how will I get through this? He's just 40 & I hate life it's torn apart & Im alone to support everyone when I'm in pieces & queston can an manage this journey alone. Also the UID2106vil case against the Priest who abused me is on my mind. The church have suspended him pending investigation. I haven't even written my statement so lawyers on both sides waiting on me. And how do I get through all this & give my kids as much support as possible, watch my husband deteriorate & visit him everyday not knowing if he will survive, get through a traumatic legal case about being drugged & raped as a kid and try act normal & strong & be the one who holds it all together? I try to be humble, I try to think of all who face pain but right now I am on verge if tears always, have moments I think I know I'm only holding on for everyone else or I think I'd be suicidal. I'm tired of being told I'm strong. I have a he'll of a year in front of me & I feel like life has stopped, I'm numb yet I'm hurting deeply, I'm weak when I'm going to have to be so strong. And I don't have any real practical support. Once people know UID1518 tend to stay away. I have no close friends & where & how am I going to get through this year.

How do I relive the abuse & trauma I went through as a young girl by a Priest I trusted how do I get justice & can anything UID1059 give me justice? Money? That doesn't come close to redemption.

"Motivation-how to stop thinking & take action,UID3332,""The past few weeks I've felt deep depression & anxiety come crashing down on me. My biggest problem is I have a lot that needs doing & I spend hours worrying & thinking about these things, telling myself I'll do it in the next hour & then keep procrastinating to the point I've achieved nothing. My UID2106rcumstances are difficult-a partner with acute leukemia & 2 children who are acting out & not coping. I'm also involved in a UID2106vil case against the Church for abuse I suffered as a child. Yet despite those things I was very strong & coping with it all until 2 weeks ago. Yes I was running on adrenaline but at least I was on top of things in terms of being the main support for my family. UID2181 I'm highly anxious & unable to get it together to do simple things. For example I've done all the washing the past few weeks yet there are 8 baskets in my room that need sorting & put away. It takes me at least an hour each morning to build up myself to even have a shower.im ashamed of this & spent most of my thoughts worrying about what I haven't been able to achieve. Does anyone have tips on how to deal with no motivation, too much worrying & no action?"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Why do I feel like there is more going on with me? There is a distinct line between managing on a daily basis with your emotions having highs and lows, and dealing with depression, separation, trauma, loss and grief? Or am I the only one?

I was hit by a lot of judgment to the point where I would get anxious.people(workers) would watch me work because of the pace and the enthusiasm I had.i watched them try to as UID1518 say get in people's heads(mindgames)I seen groups of people target people on these work sites.after putting up with this for years it slowly broke my confidence and I would get anxious at work.to the point where anxiety had set in solid.i left that job any was hit with the same thing at another job(new)I went in with a unsettled mind tense serious.i quit that job as the bullying got very bad. anxiety made me slowly stop doing what I like.because being judged had been woven into my thought pattern.then came depression i have been fighting this by myself for 8 months it's been the hardest thing I've ever done.my partner is not very supportive.i tryed explaining but there was no getting threw.i also lost my licence so I was home bound all summer 6 months was very hard.ive never taken meds and never stopped fighting it.never stopped working and try my hardest to stay active.its been very hard but I'm getting threw it.i told childhood friends and UID1518 also didn't understand telling surrounding friends(saying I'm loosing it)I also tried to tell a friend I work with and it was spread threw my new job.witch made me feel betrayed.and even worse.coming to the end of this I'm starting not to care but I don't want to be to Mutch of a a$$hole finding the happy medium.keep fighting it I've found my character is taking a change but the old character was a victim.that was by far hell I'm still not full recoved.but never give up and adapt.i feel for people that have to go threw this. get well people.love you all,depression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I woke up feeling like I had no sleep and took my daughter to childcare. I thought if I came home without the responsibility of looking after my daughter that I could go back to sleep but I was wrong. Ive had really bad restless legs and couldn't calm down at all UID50023 and been nauseated as well. Ive been so UID1183 all day and don't know how ill be able to calm myself down tonight. my daughter doesn't go back to childcare until Friday so not sure how ill get through the week. Im going to try a bath and see how that goes but not sure. my daughter is still awake and its often hard to get her to bed at night as she resists. Just haven't had a good day today and not sure how to get my depression under control. I take anti depressants and have borderline personality and dysthymia UID50023 advice would UID1059.,depression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Thoughts on Depression: don't give up hope,UID3067,""Hello brothers and sisters, and yes we are all brothers and sisters in this fight. First off I am not nor would I want to be any kind of professional head shrink, I am just a redneck (yabo lol) that has and still is fighting this demon we call depression. First off a lot of you and a lot of other people have asked. """"Do we ever get better?"""" The answer is yes with UID1059, either through medication or simply talking through it, but and as always there is a flip side to this coin, I honeslty think that once you go through a major depression and you come out on the other side we are still in danger of back sliding. I feel that its kind of like a recovering drug/booze/gambler in that once you go through this beast we tend to start to over think things when we feel ourselves backsliding..we start to remember all the negative things that we went through and we can accidently amplify them. Depression is a true demon simply because it takes so much from us and leaves just a shell. This shell can smile and even laugh..and the outside world only sees this so called tough shell that this demon has left behind, yet this shell of a person that we use to be is brittle and one simple poke and we crumble to pieces. This demon takes everything that we once were. Sounds kind of strange but the truth of the matter is that depression takes our logic from us first. You see my brothers and sisters depression runs on a lot of emotions, even the good ones feeling happy down to being sad and crying all the time. We stop thinking and let the emotions run our lives and its very hard to think straight when your emotions are all over the place. And yes you can be to happy or to energetic because you will crash and that crash is a hard one. But do not give up hope, do not go looking for hope for we tend to miss a lot of things that are in front of us, but never give up on hope, let it find you. The best advice I can give to you all is simply be. Let go of the past (easer said then done I know) do not worry about the future, and live in this day, this moment. Take care of today and let the future take care of itself. Oh and let yourself be UID1183, do not be shamed of it. Everyone. yes everyone gets UID1183 from time to time, some of us just get it a bit worse then others. So keep your heads up, talk to your doctors and do not be ashamed of asking for UID1059. We UID4232 need UID1059 from time to time and this forum is one of many places to seek UID1059! Be well my family!"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Family divided over my depression,UID372,""Hey, I've been hanging round the site for quite some time before I finally got the idea to join up. So I've been dealing with depression on and off for quite some time. It's been about 11 years worth of struggling really and the cycle only just started happening again. I used to be alright in masking it but it's now starting to be a strain on myself and the family in that I never relate myself to the family and vice versa. I do have decent friends that I've been around with. However, UID1518 have been talking about work and other things which I've been uncomfortable around so I've left them for that. The reason is that I don't have a job and I can't really relate to their complaints thus far. I've seen different councillors on and off but I've never really conquered depression thus far. I think that's enough to start off with and I might see how this goes."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Feeling beaten,UID372,""Hi im a newbie to this site, I have battled depression among other issues for some years. I have been very well but in the last month or so have been on a downhill slide. I am a single mum of 3 beautiful girls but find I am very limited to being able to work atm, this has left me lonely, isolated and feeling unmotivated and just want to sleep and do nothing, as I have just moved to another area and cannot really get out I am finding strategies of UID3584ting new ppl yet alone friends very difficult. If anyone has any suggestions or wants to be friends it would be greatly appreciated. I just want to get the spring back in my step to be the best person I can be but I'm not doing that very well"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Depression - has it taken you to the end?,UID786,""Not a topic to beat around the bush. Yeh, suicidal thoughts or plans. How many of us sufferers of depression have been there? A statistic that blew me away was average suicides in Australia. About 2200-2500. Males are four times more likely to than females. UID2181 a days thats more than the national road toll. What can we do to secure our own future so we dont go down that path because of the numbers that do go all the way many are suffering depression. Our demons take their toll on our well being, our daily life and we send our family and friends packing even though it isnt intended, we do it anyway. We have limited control and that brings me to a point, an important point for the UID1183 contemplating the end of your life. To think outside the square for a few minutes before you continue on. Disconnect with your contemplated journey for a few minutes to think of the following. 1.Think of your loved ones, the sadness and grief UID1518 will experience. So sad 2.Think about an immediate change of UID1195 3.Seek UID1059. You might be thinking you are tired of seeking UID1059 but do it! Again and again you might need UID1059 but thats the way it is. Many of us know the internal pain, the numbness, the worthlessness, the feeling of tears rolling but we dont know why. Like anything in life that is negative and uncontrollable there is only two ways to silence those demons One is the selfish way and I wont consider it a fair option for your loved ones. the other is to reverse it. How do we reverse suicidal thoughts? Change of UID1195? It can UID1059. Walk away from that terrible direction. Walk anywhere. If you are that desperate then try anything life can offer so you survive. A day, a week, a month later having moved from your home, sort a job in the outback, had a holiday, toured around etc you would look back and realise that pathway was not a good plan. It was selfish and it was defeating. You'll feel proud you survived. An accomplishment. You beat it, you squashed those demons, not fully but you turned around from that path of destruction. There have been threads UID3760 on this forum that have touched me. The one that totally transformed my thinking was """"think b4 you act"""" google it with the words """"beyond blue my life has changed because of 1 decision horribly wrong"""". That poster UID1059ed me too even though my thoughts of suicide have diminished If you are heading towards that direction consider loved ones. UID372ealise your feeling of despair are temporary. Do a """"U"""" turn. UID654K UID2631's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

"Radical effort might help,UID786,""My wife and I have different types of depression so this might not suit all. I felt depression coming on. Maybe I'm lucky but I get signs, mood swings and sadness. The sadness maybe from dysthymia. At any rate it as coming on 3 days ago. This cycle normally lasts around 10 days and I push through it. Last time about 6 weeks ago I couldnt push through it. This led to me approaching it differently. Instead of staying home I asked my wife if she'd accompany me for a drive about 5 kms away to collect firewood. We did that and it was so hard. All I wanted to do was go home maybe stare at the TV or sleep. We got our full trailer load of wood then out of the blue I stopped the car and told my wife I'll be back in 5 minutes. I jogged in one direction then returned. That was hard to do also. It's like running against the tide. When we got home my instincts were to - yep retire inside to TV. Instead I did some digging in the garden. Then went to my 'man cave' to rearrange shelf items. This is when I have a little cry. It was getting harder. Again I went against the tide and trimmed some tree branches. I didnt even enter our home for a drink as the temptation to collapse was too great...drank from the tap. Finally a lot of work behind me I was to enter our home then thought it best to visit our neighbour thus delaying again the resting time. Helped my neighbour with the building of his green house which took 2 hours. A couple of days later and I'm fine. I broke that barrier. Dont know if you can try this but its worked for me. It is hard though UID654K"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Glass Walls,UID905,""Hi all, The old thread was getting a bit long, so I thought time to start a new. I thought the same with this weekend - I did my new patterns of blue and UID141, wore the beautiful black and gold dress. I went to the convention I normally go to in costume. Just for UID3800, not in costume. It is the first time since my separation from the ex, whom I went in cosplay with. It is the first time catching up with people who I haven't seen since the break up. Or I thought I would. I went and shopped a very little as I have big bills this week. I took the anti anxiety meds, tried to squash the shakes and held up the mask for the kids. The feeling wasn't good though. I tried talking to a few friends in the costume community I bumped into but it was like UID1518 didn't even know me. They soon made excuses and left. I know its busy, UID1518 see lots of people and there are so many crowds, but it felt like UID1518 just barely recognised me, and when UID1518 did UID1518 couldn't wait to leave. I looked around, and it felt like I was surrounded by glass walls. Like now that everyone on my friends list knows about my depression, how bad it got, etc UID1518 don't want to know me.

Friday spent most the day socialising, the depression/anxiety etc. sitting on my shoulder but I managed. Yesterday I spent all day doing craft and was pleased with the results. Today I was flat out getting up, felt tired, sleepy and flat as a tack. I went to a friends for lunch managing to keep it together and hiding how l was feeling. UID2181 my stomach is in knots, feel teary and so down. UID3981l like a freak, can't hold it together. I just want to feel normal and don't ask me what normal is, l don't know any more.

Yes I suffer from depression/anxiety/ptsd/gad but with the UID1059 of my shrink and a psychologist I am presently seeing on the mental health scheme, I get by. Today is a shocker, feel like a heavy weight is squashing me and I don't know why. Nothing unusual has happened that I can think of.

"Stuck between a rock and a hard place, and for I freely admit that this is my doing...sortof,UID3067,""Ok well of late been doing pretty good managing myself and my depression, doing DDP Yoga, riding a bike all in the name of getting rid of my walking cane (and man getting fit hurts!!). Well along comes my nephew in law and his wife and UID1518 moved in, UID1518 got kicked out of the place UID1518 were living in because of the fact that it was being sold (not to mention UID1518 lied and told the land lords/real estate people that UID1518 only had 2 dogs when in fact UID1518 had 6 dogs, 3 cats and a few birds). Well it happened faster then UID1518 were ready so I said UID1518 could move UID3760, once UID1518 got rid of most of the animals especially since the wife and I already have one dog. Anyways, the kids (and the """"kids"""" are 40 and 39 but really UID1518 are still kids in my eyes which I am only 39 lol) moved in, for a temporary place while UID1518 look for a new place to live. Well come to find out the Nephew in law's wife is in stage 5 kidney failure and needs to be on dialises and needs a new kidney. They have been trying to find a new place, well sort-of trying, The kidney people said she needed another address closer to them (UID1518 were living in Bathurst and that is where the kidney doctor is in) in a month's time. NO way in hell will that happen so I told the kids to relax and UID1518 could stay UID3760 until everything gets properly sorted. As she has to go in ASAP to have the dialises set up soonest (surgery and all that). So once again doing the right thing turns around and bites me in the ass. So now I have 5 dogs, and three adults living UID3760. My wife is UID3325 and lashes out a lot of times before she can control her mouth, which means I am the one that gets the lashing. This does not UID1059 my depression one bit especially when I lash back at the wife then I feel like I am a total heel because I should be in more control then she is, this will not rip myself and the wife apart I know that, but ugg it really is putting me once again in a black mood as I try to keep the peace. Why is it that when we do the right thing it always bites us in the ass or is that just me?

She just says im leaving see ya. U see the reason her son was carrying on was that he saw my son outside which he shouldn't have been he asked me if he could and I said know then told the other carers I said yes which is a lie so he had to be brought back inside. That caused the problem and I tried to be as quick as I could to go I wasn't even aloud to even my coffee! and I was having a convo with one of the carers. So on the way home she says I need to respect when she leaves as Im going in her car and that she wont take me or my kids anywhere anymore.

"Just not good enough,UID327,""Hi all. I' ve suffered from 'diagnosed' anxiety for the last 8 years. I say 'diagnosed' because I really don't understand where it came from. Lately i've felt that I'm simply not good enough for my family to go on. I have one child who is 16 years old and have not been able to have another child since. That is my first failure.....not being able to give my husband of 18 years another child. We declared bankruptcy 7 years ago and whilst we both have high paying jobs, our means became more than what we could maintain. Our friendship group consists of very wealthy people, of which we are now not so much. I feel we have been ripped off in life by not having what our friends have. We rent a house, because there is no way we could save for a deposit to buy our own home. My father was an alcoholic who passed away 6 years ago at the tender age of 55. I feel i am heading down the same track, just to cope with every day life.Life has slapped me in the face as a 38 year old adult, I am struggling to see a way out and simply wonder if my boys are better off without me......I've been drinking alcohol way too frequently simply to deal with my own demons. I am also a smoker, which my husband and son hate. I wonder if i continue to do that simply to shorten my life. Sorry if this sounds way too much, but my life basically feels like it is in a downward spiral and I'm simply at a crossroad right now...............

"Black dog returns & I still can't control it,UID3332,""I've been quiet of late. One reason was going through all the UID372oyal Commission stuff & another was I felt I didn't want to take people's time. I usually like to try & offer support but I'm sorry I haven't been great at that the past few weeks. Problem is I was kinda managing after the UID372C until this Friday when I woke up out of blue feeling the black dog had me trapped. I felt down, UID1059less, frustrated & guilty that I couldn't stop it. I've had a big pile of bills & paperwork which everyday I say I must do by tomorrow. Yet I get anxious & UID1518 don't get done. A few jobs I need to do but have this terrible immobilized feeling where I feel stuck, unable to do anything much. Why when I've been through this many times before can't I deal with it? Why am I so low & lost interest in most things. I feel like a loser. I had a plan to do something each day to improve my health as I'm very run down It was simple day 1 drink water as I usually hardly drink any, day 2 go for walk get out house, day 3 start cutting be mess I'm overusing. And I bought all this healthy food to make a soup etc & I've done nothing. I just feel so worn out that everything is a massive effort.

"Recent weeks, horrible days and where to now?,UID3556,""Dear all, dear friends This post could be placed on 3-4 other forum headings, but I've decided to lodge it UID3760. Mainly cause of the overwhelming sense of horrible depression that I've got on board with me at this time. I'm numb, I'm empty, I'm gutted and everything is just moving along like a blur. Dear friends, one week ago (Tuesday night), I lost my Mum - she fought a long long fight with cancer, but the mongrel disease took her in the end. The reason you haven't had me on Beyond Blue for some time now is that I've been back in my home town with Mum and then the last week, well, you can imagine. Yesterday was her funeral - and it was a lovely service. A year ago Mum wrote her own eulogy and it was her wish that I read it out. Which I did. I also created my own eulogy of my personal memories of Mum and read that as well. I stumbled on a few occasions, but I had my daugther up front with me, and she held my arm, to keep me going. I did the same thing for my Dad (7 years ago) and it was something that I knew I had to do for Mum as well. I must have done ok, because many people commented to me or my brother afterwards about the eulogies and how good UID1518 were. I've been away from """"home"""" now for coming up to 30 years - as I commented in part of my eulogy - and that during that time, I would have phoned the family phone number thousands and thousands of times. But now, the house is empty and I won't be phoning that number ever again. As I also said in my eulogy, I don't know how I'm going to go in the future - certainly not forward - it might just a case of sideways for a while. So I now have both my parent's no longer UID3760 (as well as a very close brother) - my dad's and brother's deaths devastated me and now my Mum (I was a mummy's boy as well). I'm going to miss her so much.  ps: I may post occasionally in the coming days - but UID1518 may be few and far between at this stage. I won't be going away, but I just have nothing inside to offer."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was dead of course as I asked many friends to try ringing it. But its on charge now and im so happy its been found as I was soo UID1183 for a while when it was missing that I actually started crying.

Ive got a terminaly ill mum who has been battling cancer for 20 years. She is my best friend and has been my rock my whole life. She is one of the most strong minded and positive humans alive. Ive always been a hard worker and so focused on my career however been made redundant twice in the last 2 years which has been a kick in the guts. Ive been in a relationship with my husband for the past 4 years and we have been married 12 months. I think my breakdown has been a build up of things over the many years that as boiled over. Initially i blamed it all on my husband saying i was not happy in our marriage The last 6 months have been aweful. Ive been so sad nearly every day.. unmotivated to do anything and just simply dont care. Ive had a constant thought in my head that i dont love my husband anymore and should leave. There are no red flags with my husband. He is amaxing, caring, kind, supportive and will do anything for me. We have just found out we are 10wks pregnate. Ive always wanted kids and a family i just didnt expect to be feeling so confused and scared about life and our future. I dont feel connected to the baby at all and dont know even if i should be having it feeling like this. Ive been getting counselling and seen a team at the hospital that have suggested meds. I have not got the script filled yet. They said i tick all boxes for clinical depression. Im not happy in myself and i hate it.

"Meltdown,UID372,""For the past year I have been getting better. Understanding why I get overwhelmed by life and learning to cope in a very difficult situation. The priest in my church has bullied me unmercifully for several years because I stood up for what I thought was right. I spoke to him UID1861 about a matter and he told me I was not fit to be a leader in the church, that I was disloyal, presumably because I did not agree with him, and a bad influence in the church. I know there are some people who agree with him, mainly I suspect because UID1518 have never heard my side of the story and it is difficult attending this church. I have decided not to leave because I see no reason for being pushed out, but he is now leaving and will be gone on Monday. I really did not expect this parting shot and I collapsed completely UID1861. Even writing this makes me cry. What really upsets me is that it is the church doing this. It is the one institution that I have looked up to believing it has good spiritual practices, love and compassion. So this has opened my eyes in a most unpleasant way and hence I suppose my depression. Silly me for having faith in people. I was really getting well again and feeling happy. My brain had 'unfogged' and I was thinking more clearly, had more energy and was begining to manage my life again. Then this happened. I don't understand why or how people can be so vicious or why I am so thoroughly intimidated, nervous and shaky. You would think I could have toughened up by now. Instead, UID3760 I am shaking all over, crying like a baby and wishing I had never been born.

"Don't have friends, feel so alone and desperate,UID2161,""Hi All, I am new to this forum. I don't know what to do my life is completely messed up. I am a 30 year old male and have been diagnosed with anxiety and dysthymia after going to see a psychologist late in 2012. I was attending regular sessions up until early this year as I wasn't getting anywhere and felt my psychologist got fed up with me not doing what he told me to do to improve things. I have one good friend who I've been close to for about 12 years now but we don't see each other as often as we used to due to the busy life he lives (work, pursuing a music career, and long time partner). We catch up maybe once every 2-3 months if that, sometimes longer. However we have regular contact online and he or I will call to have a catch up over the phone. Apart from my good friend, I don't have anyone else and no social life as a result. I have never had many friends throughout my life, in school I wasn't very popular and cool to be with and felt I wasn't really accepted by people I hung out with after high school. From the age of 18-19 to about 25 I had a small number of friends but we just drifted apart and also I cut some out of my life, and feel I have been shunned. I don't know why I have never had a group of friends. I am shy but there are other shy types with friends. I am kind to people and down to earth so I just can't work out why I don't attract friends.

"Not feeling too good,UID3739,""I don't know why but I have woken up and started crying (story of my life That's all I seem to do lately is cry, think of something and cry. think of my childhood and cry. I have so many unfinished things that need to be completed but have no motivation to do any of them. And then I feel guilty for not completing them and feel horrible, lazy and feel that I just can never finish something, to actually complete something. For eg. my eye UID206s, I bought the material and the lavender oil, i sewed up the UID206s but haven't bought the dried lavender. So now this project is in a bag and it will stay there forever. That's how hopeless I am, never can I do anything that I can finish. I have all these grand plans but never once do I go ahead with any of them. I don't have the strength or confidence to tell myself to just do it. Get up and do it. If pnly it was that easy. i haven't walked for a while and i need to. i know i do but just can't face the idea of going for a walk. i just stay inside and hibernate. i now have three days off and i don't know what to do, i am crying. i actually have a bbq lunch to go to today but not sure now if I'll go. I have so much pent up anger, hurt and emotions running everywhere. So much happening in my life right now i feel like i";"m going crazy. i wish there was someone right now that could just sit with me and give me a hug. but that feels like a child. damn the tears are flowing ad i can't stop. need to go, this is too hard, everything at the moment is too hard jo"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Depressed and angry at my ""inner child"",UID3739,""I've been writing this morning in my book to my psych about my """"inner child"""". I started writing about my childhood and writing myself as a third person. I started writing that I hate my inner child for what I have gone through. How weak I was and still am and noboby cared about me as a child, She was brought up in a very strict background where she wasn't allowed to go anywhere, have no friends or not even go to a friend's birthday party when invited. She was never allowed sleep overs or even when she turned 18 she was never allowed to go out. She had to stay home and do what her mum would say. And if she tried to say something back to her mum she would be yelled out. She had swimming lessons as a child and clearly remembers not being able to swim so what did the instructor do - push my head down the water. this would happen over and over again. Hence now I hate putting my head under water. She wanted the love from her parents but she was not """"smart enough"""" like the other siblings who would get all the attention. She was punished a week before her wedding because her mum and dad had organised something that she wanted to do but was told not to go ahead with my plan. She was 20 yrs old How lonely it was for her at school, only 1 close friend and not even allowed to go to her house. Everyone at school at groups of friends - I had none. She must have been an ugly child for no one to want to talk to her, no one to walk home with her. She craved to be a good child at school and always """"acted dumb"""" so then she could get the attention from her teachers. Maybe that's what she was wanting - attention and love from someone, just anyone. And all she wanted was a hug, a kiss and a loving supporting parents";" all she wanted was to feel loved. Maybe she never got that bond of love because she was born 10 week prem and was left in hospital for weeks and weeks. I'm sorry I needed to vent this I am so emotional today, my thoughts are everywhere some good and some not so good. Just want to be left alone. Lump in my throat, anxiety is high.

There is too much on my mind - this saturday is the auction of our home. I am stressing about finances again, work issues and I feel I am not coping. I need to tell someone that i am not coping, my head hurts and i just want to go away. I had a terrible emotional day UID1861 at the hospital doing a session. Everything seems too hard at the moment.

"Depression- our ultimate goal.,UID786,""We have quite a large community UID3760. So many people suffering depression. Most have several symptoms in common, lack of motivation, worthlessness, sleep and more sleep, moodiness and the list - well I've only scratched the surface. Sadly (and I wont ignore it) many mentioning UID1518 want to give up on life. And of course, that there is nothing left that stimulates them. Yet, this is so totally wrong. We know in our hearts and logic that there are things you can do in life that will leave you breathless with excitement, place a smile on your face for days with you ringing all your friends to tell them and some experiences that will be lifelong memories. Yet for the deeply UID1183 this sadly is all irrelevant. Either their depression is so deep UID1518 dont want to even entertain the ideas or physically UID1518 are drained by meds. What I want from this thread is for you to dream, to open up your cloudy mind to what is possible when you are in the depths of sleep or despair. As you lie there in bed have simply thoughts, simply plans to chase those experiences when your cycle has run its cruel course. So you wait till then. And a day comes when you are feeling not bad. you look at your partner and tell them to find the nearest hot air ballooning business """"we are gunna fly"""". Or hire a speed boat, light aircraft or helicopter flight, lunch at a revolving restaurant anything for that """"buzz"""". Totally out of your comfort zone? you bet ya. On the wrong tram? tell me, criticise me, suggest anything, talk, say it, I dont care, I am willing to take anything on the chin with this. Frankly, I will do anything to make progress with one person and I hope that person is you. Why? Because yes, I've been there, I've come out the other side and managed my depression to a more stable level but I never forget those times and I will fight like hell to never return there. I want you, the reader to do the same, to travel on the same journey I've endured, to hold the hands of your family and run with them ....into the sunlight as one, laughing and loving. You will not give up hope. You will wait for that day of calm and end of cycle peace to arrive and you will show that black dog where to go. And your partner/children/family members will look at you in awe, because you would have done activity that is not parallel to the symptoms of your illness. You will do it because you can, you will never give up. Your kids will love you for trying. You will fight like you've never fought before."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

All I do is cry over their pain. I cannot even manage my own difficulties. I don't know what I am going to do. I am hanging on to see my GP and ask for some UID1059.

Maybe I'm just not meant to be happy. Why should I keep fighting something I'm programmed to be? This year has been the worst. I've been married for3 years to my high school sweet heart. we decided to go on a holiday and on the second last night I got very ill and ended up in the hospital to find out I was miscarrying a baby I never knew I had growing in me It was the worst pain ever to instantly fall in love with something that has left me and come to terms with it After the loss I went to friends for UID1059 but of course people fail you and I have found myself with out my best friend of 15 years. I found my self to get more quiet and pull away from my husband. I'm just detaching myself from the world. But I think I've detached my selfs to far. I'm board and lonely I have no friends. My husband and myself are people of faith and high up in our church and every single day I feel pressure to be perfect. I can't keep being perfect anymore. I've been the good perfect virgin church going girl since I was 14 and all I want to do is go to the clubs get so drunk, expreament with drugs see what it's like to be with another man &amp";" live a life I feel so horrible saying that though because my husband is AMAZING!

I could end my relationship, watch my self hurt the love of my life and be a failure to my family and love with guilt. I will have fun for a whole but I know I will end up sad. Or just end my life and hope people will slowly forget about me and I don't have to watch people get hurt or feel hurt and sad any more. I sit in bed every night just thinking how easy would it be to end it all. I convince myself I should do it.

Not Sure Where or what I am,UID372,I feel really odd these days. I walk through the world yet it seems I am not part of it. Things happen round me but don't impact on me. I am going to stop seeing the psychologist for reasons I cannot talk about. Maybe I am so afraid of this happening because he has been such a wonderful support to me and really UID1059ed me when I was in despair. I feel I can't talk to anyone except my GP who is on holiday ATM. I have been ill and maybe I have not yet recovered but this does not explain why I feel so disconnected from everything.

"Depressed about stuffing up again,UID3739,""Why is it that everytime I do something I stuff up big timeUID50007 I hate it so much that now I am hating myself so much. I had a session last night with my regular therapist. He gave me work to do on the moodgym website. I started last night. But then I thought I would like a session next week to discuss certain issues I have but never have time to talk about it. So I emailed him last night. He replied this morning with - no I don't have any appts for the whole week, I will see you the following week and we can put these issues down on a list to talk about then. And he also told me not to email him a reply because he knew that I would be angry with him and he didn't want a reply. Oh yes I was damn angry with him - why couldn't he fit me in somewhere"; why does he have to have boundaries; So what did I do? - I emailed him back in my state of rage with him. I asked him if I could then speak with him today. His reply was no we will talk on Monday. That made me even more angry so I replied back saying that I was so damn angry with him and that I hated him. (He knows that I don't really hate him). He never replied back. So I guess I have to wait until Monday, It annoys me because I know that my behaviour was very childish, and prob manipulative as well. All I wanted was to talk to him or even better have another session. I stuff up all the time;" maybe he should give up on me for good.

"Thoughts on Depression,UID3067,""I think I have come to a startling revelation about myself, or I should say that I have come to a final conclusion. I honestly think that once you are hit with a depression such as the one that I, and many others, have gone though we're some what broken the rest of our lives. We manage and we live with depression but we never truly get """"better"""" its kind of like a recovering drug addict or recovering alcoholic. I have several friends that are recovering drug or alcohoics and UID1518... have all said the same thing, we are clean, we are better, yet one little slip, one taste and we will be off the wagon and maybe for good. Its always a battle with yourself and temptation, depression is kind of the same thing. To be brutally honest I think that depression is actually a little harder, I can not begin to imagine the will power that it takes a recovering drug or alcholoic to stay on the wagon, but both the recovering drug addicts and recovering alcohoilics have a great support system. There are UID3584tings like AA and other such things, and when these people be come clean people praise them for being clean and sober for how ever long UID1518 have managed it. But yet when it comes to depression people (and those that suffer from this disease) lay to hard of a judgement on people. Those that suffer from depression are the worst ones when it comes to judging ourselves (I am including myself in this). There is still this major stigma about being UID1183 as if some how its """"wrong"""" or people will look on the outside and say """"Well what reason do UID1518 have?"""" Honestly its easier to stay UID1183 then to try to fix what is wrong with in yourself, or at the very least its a hell of a lot easier to just say """"I am UID1183 and worthless, so why bother trying?"""" Depression still has its claws in me, I have my good days, then I have some really bad days, and I still have some major issues that I am not sure if I have the strength to stand up and change or at least work around, such as"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Depression and Physical restrictions,UID786,""As an extension of my other thread """"Depression and excercise"""" I thought I'd mention this topic of physical restrictions or injury. It's been on my mind since 3 years ago when I broke my lower leg and was wheel chair bound for 8 weeks. The first 4 weeks was so painful I didnt have the mental idol time to be UID1183 and I had to worry about my business running. Then it set in as well as impatience to get on two feet again. The trouble is my physical health is a balancing act. DVT both legs, gout that just wont go away, old back injury (well who hasnt got one?), etc. I have to admit however that I always seem to have the drive to put these things aside in my daily life....well most times anyway. I suppose I really believe that I am more fortunate than some, lucky to walk, lucky to do most things. But I also admit that at times it gets me down and seems to trigger depression. But that isnt conclusive. My depression comes and goes in short bursts now that I'm stable on the correct medication making it difficult to isolate if it is a trigger or not. This is where I need your opinions. How effected is your depression from physical issues? Did you have the depression before or after your physical restrictions came about?

Half way done and I was exhausted physically but mentally felt better. Then when it was fully dug up I was done. Arms were cramping. Got a cold drink and sat there admiring my work. I then realised my depression was gone. My wife arrived home none the wiser. I felt I also achieved in that I didnt do the ritual- talk to her about it. This was indeed a day of achievement.

"Is crying good or bad for you?,UID786,""The dreaded act of crying. That's from my view. Always large for my age in a mans world ex military, prison officer, security etc a world where crying immediately and permanently embeds weakness into other mens assessment of you. Behind the scenes the big man became himself- a weeping mess battling illnesses I never realised I had. That was from as long as I can remember until 2 years ago or so. Then...the crying stopped! I've wondered if that has been good or bad...and why it stopped. Crying is thought to release stress hormones in the body. So there is a reason for it. It can be socially attractive to do in some cases. Attracting UID1059 for example. For me- I always ended up with a headache! if I cried. So why did I stop crying? Well I can paint a short picture of the UID2106rcumstances. What was happening prior to 2 years ago? My medication had been correct after many years of false diagnosis and wrong medication from that false diagnosis. I'd dated and married my wife 3 years ago. So there are some changes, but it doesnt address something. Within those two years I'd had 2 meltdowns or """"episodes"""" as my doctor called them whereby on both occasions wandered aimlessly where ever my body took me. Fully in a depressive state but I did not cry. I recently felt UID1183. My depression doesnt last long nowadays. But I walked into the bush and sat, for hours, numb. I was aware a film of water enveloped my eyes but no tears fell. That's odd I think. Then I walked home. I needed the connection to nature, I needed to be alone. I was not suicidal. Planned that 18 years ago and I'll never go there again nor put my loving family through what could have been. That avenue IMO is stupid and selfish. Both my brother and uncle went that way I read on this forum upset people telling us UID1518 have cried all day. I feel for them, UID1518 must be hurting, UID1518 must be feeling empty and hopeless. They likely do not see any relief in their pain. Well there is relief, there are answers there- UID1518 are just in your line of sight, just beyond your reach and it is in the form of management. 1. Correct diagnosis 2. Correct medication 3. Correct quantity of medication. 4. Appropriate professional support 5. The will to get better 6. Environment 7. Supportive family and friends. 8. Less work pressure and so on. Achieve some of these and the light at the end of the tunnel might get closer and brighter. And you just might cry less. And I still dont know if crying less or more is better for you...."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Hi there!,UID372,""Hope you're all really well. My name's  and around four weeks ago, I got officially diagnosed as having depression. It wasn't a surprise, though, and just confirmed what my wife had been noticing for a couple of years. I started becoming very introverted, withdrawing from the daily life of friends and family. More to the point, I stopped interacting with our daughter, always finding an excuse to do nothing or be distracted by things on my phone instead of hanging out with them. I imagine like most people, it just got to a stage where I couldn't function any more. My head always felt so swollen, almost like a really bad head cold minus the sniffles. I haven't really divulged it to a lot of people. To the people that do know, however, I've received a lot of support and understanding of where I am. Work has an unlimited EAP resource for us and I'm making progress with meds. Unfortunately, the suicidal thoughts just won't go away. I'm running/exercising/doing whatever it takes to ease my mind but it's taking time. I'm being as proactive as possible to try and stay positive throughout these initial days and I'm hoping that there'll be a stage where I feel 'normal'...whatever that means. I'm looking forward to being a part of the community UID3760 to talk openly about where I am and to hear of others' experiences.

So we had coffee and the conversation with our friends lingered on and on. Eventually my mood fouled more and I announced to my wife- """"we leave in 5 minutes or I leave by myself"""". We left in a few minutes and started our day at a cafe but the depression had well and truly set in. By this time I was trying to feel the change in my brain. Started to study my body for reasons that set off the mood. Was it- -the bad dream -lack of sound sleep -boredom the day before leading to impatience this morning -my wife's lack of knowing how needy I was to get on the road -my depression cycle coming around -music....I had the tune of the bodyguard in my head...I'm a sucker for sad tunes. -being away from home in  We had been at our friends for one week. We'd been camping for 3 days happily and the following 4 days we great, jovial, laughing - perfect atmosphere. What I do know. Is that my wife is not to blame . My communication was reasonable and my sense of urgency was obvious. But my impatience came around really quickly..in fact it came during our drinking our coffee, within a 5 minute period. Medication has been great and am on the maximum of the mood stabiliser prescribed. An anti depressant is ok and prefer not to take a higher dosage. Also my feelings just after I lost patience was like my eyes were welling up. 10 years ago I would have cried for hours and had headaches from that. But the flushed feeling I had this morning might be due to the chemical reaction causing the depressionUID50007UID50007? Does anyone else have this flushed feel? How many of you can relate to the above UID2106rcumstances listed as being a trigger for depression.? and out of it after 8 hours."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"this is all a bit new to me,UID95,""Have been treated for depression with ad meds for the past 15 years or so. Was always on the same low dose till about 12 months ago when things started to go down hill. Then in recent months Ive been on a roller coaster merry go round of alternating highs and lows. Yesterday I was voluntarily admitted to Perth Clinic and my diagnosis has been changed from depression to bipolar2. This is no great surprise to me as my gp mentioned that this might be the case. I have stopped the ad meds and last nite started on mood stabilizers.

"I Don't Know,UID3556,""Dear all Thanx for your posts. I don’t know at all – I think it can be a fine line as well – with so many things. Whether you’re UID3760 or you’re not. Whether it’s sunshine, whether it’s cloudy or whether it’s just a miserable cold foggy morning. You leave you animals and dog at home and off you go to work. You spend whatever hours you have to at that place. Then you head back to your “home”. Where you live. Where the food is, where the plates are. The dishes, the ever constant dishes that just build up – almost like magic. How can there be that many dirty dishes in UID3800? The TV’s are there, the computer is there. The clothes are there – we have to be UID3760. We have to. We have heaters to keep us warm in winter. Our bodies are all different – everyone is different. Just look at your fingerprints to reveal that. Some of us like tea, some like coffee, some like water – some like spicy food – some enjoy jazz music, others enjoy western or heavy metal. With every choice in your life, you are creating a path – a path that you have to travel on. So I guess when you don’t want to exist, you just don’t make any decisions. Therefore, does the path stop? Or do you stop? I think the path is always there – and maybe you are on a travelator, that moves you along. Just while you sit with your head in your hands – but what are you contemplating? I don’t know.  ps: my DOG days are counting up - and you know, I somehow feel better for doing that - my stomach was just getting way out of control - I had to do something. Maybe it's not drinking that is causing me to be so terribly down. I don't know. I don't think so. I think it's other things.

I felt the need to contact with someone. I just came back from second session with my new psych. We are working challenging thoughts. It makes sense but it will take time. I knew that from the beginning, just this week has been so wretched that everything seems a monumental task. I made muffins UID1861. I sang and danced in the kitchen to the tunes of Sweeney Todd. My friend who was also having a hard night is going to come over today. We were meant to make muffins but I don't know if we'll have time now. On the way home from the psych I felt so bad I was just silently crying slowly as I was driving. It's a skill. I stopped off on the shops, sunglasses on and all in order to spend my last twenty for the week on skittles and childrens stickers. The shinier the better. In my hospital admission, a friend of mine in there (fellow patient) held a slumber party of sorts and we had colouring in books, pizza and I decorated my various gadgets with bright glittery puffy stickers. I bought these to finish the job ad decorate the cbt file my psych gave me. I bought them because I thought it would make me happy, or least give me something to do. It makes me kind of sad though it reminds me of the hospital and how safe I felt. How I had hope when i lefft for all of two days before I crashed. I am unlikely to be able to see my psychiatrist to change meds this week. She is just too busy. I could see a doctor on duty but UID1518 don't know my entire history.

"Uncertainty and fear,UID905,""""""Depression is a prison where you are both the suffering prisoner and the cruel jailer."""" ~Dorothy UID372owe How am I today? Afraid and uncertain. I made good progress these past few days. I went shopping most days for this or that. I even did the dishes. TWICE. So why do I feel so bad. I was out doing things. Achieving things. This should make me feel better. So why do I feel this crushing weight on my shoulders now? Why does the thought of next week fill me with dread? I think I know the answer to that one. I have my first volunteer shift on Monday. Just three hours. Three hours I get to spend with cats, volunteering to UID1059 out at the cat shelter. Cats make me happy. It's only three hours. That should make me happy. But I'm not. I am afraid. So terribly terribly afraid. My monsters keep whispering to me about what could go wrong. They keep whispering about how I'll screw it up. Normally I have at least a little strength to fight it off, or at least shrug it off and let the social anxiety of missing this appointment carry me through those three hours. I look inside and all I find is emptiness. These past few days, I almost felt like a person again. Hell I can shorten that sentence. I almost FELT. Where did that person go? II saw her, glimpses of her in the edges of my vision. I can't even see her now, where did she go? It hurts too much to hope. Hope should be a big positive, glowing thing but in my mind it is but a flickering candle flame. I don't dare com out of the dark towards that light because I can't trust it. It might go out any minute. I'll be left in the dark again, the dark I know so well. Worse, I'll be left in the dark with the memories of what that light was, what it could have been. I'm not sure why I am posting. I just felt all these thoughts, like a pressure inside my head. I had to let it out somewhere. It's chaos in my head at the moment, voices shouting over voices";" faces appearing in the crowd only to disappear a split second later. I don't know if I'm making sense. I don't know.... I wanted to apologise for not posting much lately. I just can't hear over all the voices, to get one clear line of thought sometimes. And then there is the effort of coming on UID3760 and pushing all these keys to get it out. Then the waiting, the anxiety as I hope it gets posted. I hope someone sees. The fear that something will go wrong and it will disappear and I'll have to type the thing out again, which seems all too hard. So you see I am having trouble UID1059ing myself right now. I don't know how to UID1059 others. It' like offering a hand down to UID1059 someone up and over a cliff edge. I don't have the strength in my arms when the ground is crumbling beneath my own feet.

She wants me to be hospitalised to receive what I believe to be an extreme form of treatment usually reserved for few cases. My husband and I are in total dear. He's making me go to my mums for the week. But I have to get there myself and its an hr away. I can't even seem to pack a a bag as I'm so afraid of what power my psych has. Can she force this on me? I also saw mt GP to get a referral to a did rent Pyschiatrist but I can't afford her-$470 per session!! I'm frightened, crying, feel no hope, don't know how ill get thru this. I know I have to get to my mums before I do anything which gives my Pyschiatrist reason to do what she would do ie hospitalise and force draconian treatment. I'm so so scared. I just want to be held & told it will be ok. But it won't. I won't have computer at mums just iPhone so I can still come on UID3760. What else can I say? Never ever beloved I could ever be in this situation & I'm self aware etc-the treatment she wants me to have is I thought-only used in extreme cases. I'm so lost now.

"I find it hard to justify seeking help, as it doesn't seem serious enough,UID372,""Apologies if this a long post.. I'm finding myself back in a place that I seem to get every few months or so. Its a complicated feeling, i wouldn't say i'm emotional, i wouldn't say i'm sad, if anything, i have no real emotion, not sad, not happy. I withdraw when i'm in these moods, i don't want to leave the house if i can avoid it, i stop going to training because i don't want to be around the people, i avoid social gatherings. Any confrontation that i might have with someone will leave my completely drained and emotionless for at least a day or two. Today i just couldn't handle work, just had this anxious feeling i couldn't get rid for a few hours. The problem is, these moods on any given day can be normal. I start to wonder if i'm over complicating, trying to look too deeply for a solution to a problem that could be solved simply. Maybe i'm just more comfortable on my own. Maybe i'm not sleeping well because i always have to get up a 5am for work. Maybe its normal to not feel strong feelings either way for your fiancee for weeks at a time. I can usually just get through being rational. I know i care for my fiancee, and i am grateful for the life we are building. And every now and then i do feel strong feelings of love for her. i can get through work without emotion, because its just a series of problems to solve. I'm not a zombie, i am still capable of laughing at a joke, i still see my parents on the weekend, i'm not constantly miserable. I see a problem, i come up with a solution. But i keep coming back UID3760, where I realise i have been completely unemotional for the past week or two, been completely unmotivated to do anything other than what i need to do, but feeling no joy about it. Where everyone seems to irritate me, but i cant handle any confrontation without it draining me. It doesn't feel extreme, but it has repeated itself time and time again for years. One time when i was 18 i packed all my things and tried moved interstate to get away from everyone, family and friends. After 3 months i came back once i realised i didn't hate being around them. Is this depression? is it possible to have less extreme cases, where it doesn't end relationships or careers, but stops you from socialising, or makes you unable to reciprocate feelings of love and joy for a time? I have seeked medical advice before, but its not an easy thing to explain to a GP in a 15min session. Once time it was a disaster, one GP diagnosed me with bipolar (after ONE consultation) and put me on medication which turned me into a complete zombie for two days before i got a second opinion. Ironically, once i came off the medication it seemed to snap me out of it. I guess i just want to see if people can relate to what i'm feeling. I just find it hard to justify seeking UID1059, as it doesn't seem serious enough, but then again, i'm sick of having to drag myself out of a slump every 2 months."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Broken Heart,UID3332,""Hi all, my previous thread named """"No hope this week"""" was getting a bit too long so today I'm extending and continuing the themes of that post. Yes I have a broken heart. I am aching from the current constant state of emotional &amp"; mental pain. I have cried as soon as I wake up for the past two weeks. Just to contextualise I will refer to my last post where I described my experience of a sudden severe onset of deep depression &amp; thoughts I had never really experienced before as in I wouldn't act on them because my kids have always been my safety net. I experienced a severe onset of depression without any triggers &amp; I was feeling completely out of control of my thoughts, unable to function barely at all to the point I couldn't even get dressed &amp; I felt totally immobilised &amp; absolutely terrified of my mental state. I had never had contact with an acute mental health team but due to my distress &amp; complete sense of being out of control, Beyond Blue contacted them on my behalf. The nurses visited me at home &amp; were lovely. They made me an appointment with the acute team pyschiatrist last UID3550. Unfortunately the pysch was young &amp; obviously inexperienced. It was only a 15min appt &amp; the sole purpose was to check I wasn't having intentions to do anything terrible. I was hoping for some referrals to other forms of support &amp; a medication review. But the pysch said he would be phoning my private pysch that day to update her &amp;" to """"hand over care"""". So I waited &amp"; remained in my terrible state of mind. I progressively got worse. I hadn't heard from my own Pyschiatrist so I rang her today &amp; she was completely unaware of what was happening. I asked her if the acute team had explained my situation &amp;" couldn't believe it when she replied """"oh yes UID1518 left a message last week for me to call them but I haven't got to it yet"""". I was so shocked-this is a Pysch I've been seeing for over 8 yrs. so I told her all that had happened &amp"; that my husband was adamant that I crashed when I began taking the stimulant medication she had prescribed &amp; I had commenced it on 10 January &amp; fell apart on the 20th January. She replied that she didn't think UID1518 were related &amp; perhaps the current widespread news about abuse in the Catholic Church had triggered it. I replied that I hadn't seen any news on the subject &amp; wasn't even aware it was a current issue in the media. She then said to stay on my medication &amp; she would see me next Monday &amp; discuss possible triggers for my sudden crash &amp; also discuss medication. I even told her I had never experienced an episode like this &amp; I certainly have never had serious thoughts of taking drastic action-and her reply was that if I felt some sympathetic nurses would cheer me up then I could ask the Acute Team to visit. I was beyond words when the phone call ended. This is supposed to be my treating pysch who I've known for over 8 years. My husband who took the morning off work due to my state, called BB distressed &amp; said he couldn't cope with what was happening &amp; needed support for me as he just couldn't cope with what was happening &amp; the lack of support services for me. I then said to him I felt safe enough this afternoon to be alone &amp; would occupy myself by coming UID3760 &amp; writing &amp; also looking up GPs &amp; Pyschologists. There is still the major critical issue of a decent Pyschiatrist. So basically I have to survive until Monday &amp; the only other option or change would be if I continued having serious thoughts-in that event I would be admitted to hospital. So how do I feel after explains all the current facts-I feel so upset, desperate, alone, frightened, overwhelmed &amp; broken hearted at the current state, the underfunded &amp; lack of support services for mental health compared to other health areas, the sadness &amp; fear at being overwhelmed by this illness, and most of all today my heart breaks at the loss &amp;" grief I feel for struggling so hard to """"find my real self"""" under the layers of the illness &amp"; sadness that my family rarely see &amp; enjoy experiences with the person I truly am beyond this illness. They see the symptoms &amp; the struggles &amp; my mum cried &amp;" my husband was distressed at how much this illness has taken from my life. They say how much UID1518 """"miss me"""" &amp"; how it breaks their hearts to know who I truly am &amp; to grieve for that person because UID1518 now mostly see the effects of the illness &amp; the rare glimpses UID1518 see of the person UID1518 know I am makes it even harder as UID1518 miss me so much. I grieve for myself too-I am so sad knowing I still exist but I'm hidden under layers of pain &amp; trauma &amp; the devastation this illness can cause. Will I ever feel happy again? Will I ever return to the bright social butterfly who had many friends. Will I ever feel a sense of achievement again when I was such a high achiever &amp; thrived on mental stimulation &amp; challenges. Will I ever break this despair? This loss of the real me? Will I ever be social or interact again given I'm completely isolated &amp; rarely leave the house &amp; have no one to talk to from the time my kids go to school to the time UID1518 come home? And the biggest question-will I ever experience recovery or even hope of some forms of recovery? I'm so broken by this constant battle. And the destruction it creates in so many ways ie low or zero Selfesteem, feeling a failure, losing confidence in most of my abilities, blaming myself for anything, apologising for anything to the point I'm almost apologising for my existence, feeling unlovable, avoiding people &amp; situations because I fear being transparent as a loser. Fearing this could get even worse. So basically fearing a lifetime of struggle to find myself again when I'm up against a monster of an illness that's winning at the moment. I'm too afraid to think of the future because if this is my future then my existence is purely for the sake of my children. And I'm so sad because if I had known the battle I'd have with depression, traumatic events, PTSD &amp; anxiety-I would of crammed so much into my life before it hit me so at least I'd experienced happiness &amp; adventures &amp; many different experiences so at least I could say I made the most of and lived my life to the absolute fullest before I got sick. I don't in anyway want to or mean to come across as a victim in feeling sorry for myself. I know there are so so many people hurting &amp; struggling in so many ways &amp; forms &amp; it can always be worse. So my intention isn't meant to express myself as the only person in pain. I am grateful for many things such as my children &amp; living in a country without war or external traumas. I try to be thankful &amp; humble for what I do have &amp; do think of and feel for all people in pain or suffering whatever form it may take. I just felt so sad today I needed to try express myself to keep me safe &amp; to clarify my thoughts by attempting to express them-as in doing so I thought I might feel some of the fog lift. So I've literally just written this without thought &amp; I hope it makes sense. I think of, and feel for all of you experiencing pain &amp; battling this illness. I care &amp; hope I can support many of you on this journey. And I'd also like to express my sincere gratitude for all of you &amp; especially to thank those who have provided me with hope &amp; care. Today I know one of my dear friends is battling through this illness &amp; my heart goes out to them. I hope each of you experience some hope, support &amp;" care. Lve Mares xxx"",depression"
"My head feels like it's full,UID1277,""As the heading says, i'm feeling flat. I want company but i have restrictive funds for this coming week. Family things are starting to get on top of me along with my own personal issues, i just feel i'm about to crack under pressure, i'm not sure just how much more of this i can take. I'm ready to erupt like a volcano if this pressure doesn't lift. My head feels like it's full and take in anymore information, it just isn't ready and either is my body i can feel it. At the same time i need to look for work to earn money but i just don't feel ready my meds make me tired and so i'm yawning all the time it just feels so hard. I may come across like i'm going well but this thread i'm just letting all things come out into the open.

"Tears Part II,UID3556,""Hi all I think the last post of """"Tears"""" possibly got too big for its boots ... not that it was wearing any ... it just slops around in flip-flops, or what Aussies call, thongs. (UID2181 I've got you thinking haven't I? Who is this guy ... is he Americaan or something?) No folks ... just a plain old Aussie boy, just thought I'd try for a bit of an unusual start to this post. Seeing as I can't cry I may as well be silly. :) And to answer some questions posed to me of late ... I am feeling, um, a little better. But that comes and goes, don't it. Had a rather crap day on Friday, but so far Saturday is going along much better - I think. Have already been to the gym and smashed out a brilliant workout of chest and finished with biceps. Two favourite body parts to workout. This arve, I have a physio session ... and my physio is a wonderful person as well as being highly talented in her field of expertise ... she's almost like a 'closet' psych. She's been awesome for me in the past. Yes, I'm on meds ... each and every day ... and heavy amounts of them. Take one variety each morning";" and then about an hour before beddy byes time, I take two other different varieties. I often think when I hear of the awful struggles that so many posters have on this site where UID1518 can't get to sleep ... I just wish that their psych's or precribing authority would give them appropriate meds so that UID1518 can get to sleep as well. If I didn't have these nightly tablets to take, then I would be one of the many who suffer to the trauma of not being able to sleep at night. And let's face it, if you ever saw me, you'd be glad that I get a reasonable amount of beauty sleep ... otherwise it (I) wouldn't be a pretty sight !! And before I wrap this Part II post up, yes, I have my psychologist appointment for next Thursday, 13th February at 10:30am. And on that day, 23 years ago at 3:20pm, was the time that I lost my brother. Not that I'm counting mind you! UID50023 So Saturday progresses along ... little to smile about. But hey, it's another day. Kind regards "",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Transient.,UID905,""If someone asked me """"How are you?"""" that would be my honest answer right now. Transient. I feel like I am inbetween one place and the next,except I can't see what that next place is. I'm going somewherebut i don't know where I am going. Is this bad? I know I'd prefer to know where I was going, to give me a goal to work towards so I could speed this up. I don't enjoy being in between. It makes me feel like there's no point making a home UID3760, because I am going to be somewhere else and where I am right now isn't permanent. Lately I haven't felt anything. Like in my head I should be feeling something right now, but I can't. I can't feel anything, good or bad. It makes me wonder if there is real emotion there and my head is hiding it from me because it is too painful to feel right now. Like I open up a door and instead of finding answers, I just find a sudden deep black abyss. There should be something there, not a hole. Do I not know the answers? Or is my own head protecting me from them? If my head is protecting itself from them, then how could I trust myself. How can I trust what I think or feel at a given time because it might not be real, it might just be a smokescreen thrown up by a part of my head that thinks it knows better. Can I ever trust even simple things like I do like that movie or I don't like that show. These questions are the wind that blows up from the abyss, dark and cold as I stand there looking at it and feeling nothing. I don't know if this even makes any sense to anyone else.

"No hope this week,UID3332,""Hi all i think I was about to go for my appt to see the Acute Team Pysch when I past wrote. He turned out to be yeRs young & arrogant. I think I was more self aware than he was used to so he tried to criticise the meds I'm on but then saying he can't sdp, change or recommend anything-as long as I went suicidal he was going to ph & refer me bk to my own private pysch. I was supposed to see her last Thursday but I hadn't slept for 41 hours & I couldn't go-I couldn't think straight & I knew I needed to be able to lake things in when I saw her. So now I have appt for mon 10 Feb but cancellations usually come up so I should see her this week. Several people have said just to stop taking the stimulant med as it's been a drastic decline last 2 wks. This wkend meant to be going down coast to stay for my husbands friends wedding. But as I keep telling him I'm not in a state to go to a wedding with no one I know & I'm not even looking forward to going away as home is my safety net comfort zone. My mind & thoughts are scattered, I can't concentrate or remember things. Even my mum is saying I don't talk like me-I'm unclear, finding communication difficult. She is concerned at my mental state as she's never seen me so unwell. She says to just tell my husband I can't go-he can still go, but he'd be so mad at me. I'm just feeling alone & had hoped to have advice/changes by now. But I may try lower dosages of the stimulant because someone like me who is generally always anxious-what benefit for me is there in taking a stimulant. Anxious, down, lost & feeling it's all too overwhelming. Anyway to sum up I feel awful. Exhausted beyond words. So my dear friends I'm wondering how you all are & I carry you in my heart.

"can depression be brought on by a loved one?,UID999,""I met with my psychologist UID1861 afternoon. This is the first session I've had with her where i was able to speak properly about everything, without turning into a blubbering mess. It was also the first session where I was able to look at my relationship with  objectively, without just """"wanting her back"""" as i had for the previous 5-6 weeks. She didnt say it in exact words, but she suggested that my depression may have been brought on by  and the way she had been treating me. Over the last 6 months of our relationship, she convinced me to leave a job i loved and we had to relocate, when that job didnt work out she assured me there was enough in savings for me to resign and look for a new job. All the savings money was in her name so i was left with no money and became a virtual hermit for 6 months as she kept making excuses to not put money into my account, and because we only had 1 car i was left with no transportation. This had been happening (money stuff etc) for approximately 2 years before we made the move Finding the stuff on the computer that showed me she had been cheating on me was the best thing that ever happened to me (as stupid as that sounds) as it allowed me to see her for what she really was. Previous to that I was always of the opinion i was lucky to have her, she was better than me and i should be greatful. She will blame me for my moods changing for our relationship breakdown, but i feel my depression and subsequent mood changes were brought on by her actions towards me, turning me into a prisoner in my own home. The releif i have felt since knowing it was over has been undescribable, knowing its finished and being able to see everything how it really was. My blossoming relationship with  is also a fantasic feeling UID1059ing feel better, but even without that, knowing that of my life is finished is pure relief. Has that happened to anyone else, to have a person who you loved and lived with to bring the depression on with their actions? Something i wrote last night, directed at  You thought you won? You left me a broken man You left me with no money You left me with no job You left me with no car You left me with no home You left me alone Did you win?

"Avoidance & Selfesteem issues,UID3332,""Hi all, I was about to reply to my dear friend  when I realised there was a common thread through many people's stories & situations. So many of experience low Selfesteem, lack of confidence, fear of future, feel like a failure. And for some people the way UID1518 cope is to use avoidance strategies to escape the pain & experiences UID1518 are dealing with. For so long I have used avoidance behaviour whenever I could to cope. This may be taking extra medication, drinking, escaping into another situation etc. but I just thought I'd mention it as its a big part of depression. And when we cannot feel hope, we do the next best thing-try to escape the situation (& this includes harm issues). I don't have the answered & right now I wish I could escape/avoid how I'm feeling-but in my situation the depression has overwhelmed me beyond my usual point of hiding it & coping with it. But I have always had low Selfesteem, I have always blamed myself for anything & everything. I apologise for things that people say """"why are you apologising?), I see myself as a failure with no hope. Yet 10yrs ago I was in a high level job & was a different person. UID2181 escaping into work was also an avoidance issue in some ways as I excelled at work but had experienced post-natal depression so I thought my kids were better in daycare. But UID1518 weren't happy & missed me & I eventually gave up work to be there for them and I'm so glad I did-yet the isolation when there is no one around is hard to manage. And from the reading I've done of people's stories-there seems to be an initial trigger or memory of painful experience from the past that UID1518 are still dealing with, as well as current issues which collide & bring us down. We may not even be able to identify the trigger/issue of pain as we have buried it deep & are now just coping with symptoms like me rather than moving on tie taking the next step of confronting or facing painful feelings, memories & thoughts. I don't know if any of this makes sense. I started off thinking of  & then thought so many of us may experience feeling at the bottom of the world.

"Part 3 Crisis Update,UID3332,""Hi aallI was supposed to see a Pyschiatrist at the local hospital UID1861 as part of the acute team. But my taxi never turned up &amp"; the Dr couldn't wait so now I have to wait to see him next week. I am extremely low, still struggling with overwhelming thoughts of survival. My husband who had stayed working in NZ last week came home Thursday night. He usually works at home Friday but UID1861 he went into work. He is returning to NZ tomorrow for another week. He really doesn't understand. He is asking me things like what will be for dinner each night-I can't even think of dinner. I'm trying to cope in half hour blocks. I don't know &amp; I'm worried how to organise the kids for school this week. And next weekend my husband and I are meant to be staying down South Coast for a wedding. He seems to think I can just go back to feeling normal whenever I'm needed. But I can't. And I almost wish to go to hospital to have a break to get support for me. But that won't happen. I'm noticing I'm getting more anxious &amp; afraid when I think of things I should have done ie pay bills &amp; can't face anything at moment. Has anyone just had an acute reaction to depression that comes out of nowhere &amp; takes over your thoughts &amp; you can't identify a trigger? Because I've had depression &amp; anxiety for years &amp; usually I can tell I'm feeling low, know deep down what the triggers were &amp; knew the type of support I needed. In such cases yes things may go by the wayside but I focus on something like reading which I usually love &amp; I escape into that when I'm feeling low. But this time I can't concentrate to read, have zero interest in anything &amp; feel so immobilised by my fear that I barely get through the day usually by reading on Beyond Blue. I cannot face people &amp; couldn't imagine at all going out or doing anything I'd usually be able to do. I have also never previously considered hurting myself as my kids are everything to me, so UID1518 are a kind of safety net &amp; I'd never ever do anything because I'd rather suffer through the depression than do something that would destroy them &amp; I could never hurt them or leave them. Yet like the other things I've mentioned, this is the first time that my pain &amp; out of control thoughts are stronger than my usual safety net (my kids). It's the first time ever that the thoughts are stronger than my ability to survive for my kids. The out of control thoughts tell me UID1518 would be better off long term rather than having a mother in this state &amp;" my husband could UID3584t someone else. That in itself is proof of my current state of mind. I'm not """"me"""" at the moment. I really hope to see a psych ASAP. I'd be interested if anyone has ever had a similar situation-where severe depression just comes from nowhere &amp"; you feel completely out of control of your thoughts &amp; feel terrified by being out of control, especially the thoughts of not wanting to continue-existence issues. Any similar experiences would be appreciated. So to sum up-I'm in an awful place but I'm holding on by reminding myself next week will hopefully provide more support &amp; some changes in treatment-therefore UID1059ing me out of the current situation. I can't say thank you enough for reading, replying &amp;" being my main support at this time. My heart goes out to all experiencing a difficult time-you remain in my thoughts.

"A Helping Hand,UID1277,""It's January 27 2014 and the time is 1.30pm. As i sit on my bed listening to music, i think about how all of us UID3760 at BB have come together to give a Helping Hand to each of us. We have all come from many different backgrounds, had many different ups and downs in our lives but there is one thing we all have in common that is we are seeking UID1059 and guidence to overcome our mental illnesses. We offer advice, support and encouragement to each and everyone of us, to lift us up of the ground and to give us a UID638 when we are in need of someone willing to offer their hand in our time of need. As we get pulled up of the ground by each of us, we say thankyou and give that person a hug. That person is also willing to offer their shoulder to have a cry on, an ear to listen to us and a mouth to voice support and encouragement. To each and everyone of you i say: THANKYOU, I HAVE FAITH IN YOU, I BELIEVE IN YOU, I ENCOURAGE YOU, BE STRONG, BE DEFIANT AND STAND TALL. We will all make it and that it will be ok. To Beyond Blue: From the bottom of my heart THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ONGOING SUPPORT TO EACH OF US. I think all of us should give Beyond Blue a big round of applause for the advice, support and encouragement UID1518 have all given and continue to give us all.

"What is me, what is the depresssion and what's the med? What I think...,UID4087,""HI I have read many posts and where people were wondering how the 'real me' feels. With me I can tell the difference in my UID2781r plexus( the area behind your breastbone).The real me, my soul is there, the real me lives there. If depression/anxiety takes hold that area hurts, it crushes my chest and I cant 'be'.I want to run, die, or cut the feeling out. The med manages to take that feeling away and replaces it with a positive warm feeling. I know the real me is the positive warm feeling since I did experience this feeling before-but only randomly since my mental health was 'suboptimal' and I was down in the dumps. So I believe there is only one real me- that one which can only exist with the med. So the real me was always there, and is still there, but the depression/anxiety suffocated those warm positive feelings and I could therefore never feel the real me. So now I can at least feel and am grateful for that. I lack the negative feelings which I don't miss. Sorry this post probably doesn't make any sense-but I thought it may UID1059 people to learn feeling again. My compass for the state of my mental health is my UID2781r plexus. Its good to be able to feel that part again and not wanting to cut it out of my chest! UID4087"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Staying strong for others, not myself.,UID905,""So dear Jo asked how I was but I felt bad about taking over her thread. I would have posted on ymy old thread except I promised I would start a new one. Even if today is far from good, I wanted to live up to some promise I made. I'm not good today. I am feeling like breaking down due to pressures from my favourite pressure points that I haven't dealt with this past year and I am torn about what to do about it. I want to practice the techniques my psych taugh tme but the monsters are resisiting hard today. Every moment that I don't do them just gives them more strength. That leads to more indecision and...well. This leads to a vicous cycle of thoughts I am trapped in at the moment. Add to that there is housework I should have done but haven't and despite sleeping all day after being sleep deprived, I am still exhausted. If I crawl into bed I will be giving up on getting anything done which is tossing another steak to my monsters. At the same time I don't know if I can do any good not in bed. I can't breakdown though because I am worried about my friend who is extremely ill right now and my husband is not doing great. So I am going to keep an eye on him tonight and take him to the doctors tomorrow. Other people need me to be strong, to be UID3760 and present so I am. It all feels like a layer of ice though, underneath which is a heaving ocean. I am tossed around by all these emotions and thoughts. They all feel so real. At the same time all I can think is that right now my good friend is fasting for a life threatening operation to remove a tumour. She has all these real problems and I'm sitting UID3760 unable to get up and do the dishes because I'm to weak to even do that. I just keep thinking that if there is any power in the universe, to take the sickness from her. She is such a lovely person, she doesn't deserve what she is going through right now. Give it to me, if someone has to get sick, to die. I'll take it. Just leave her be. None of this I'd feel right about saying out loud. Like I said, I have to be strong for her. I feel it though. Then I feel bad for feeling it, i feel bad for feeling bad... Vicous UID2106rcles and all that. So yeah, I'm not conflicted and not good today.

"appt with GP,UID3739,""So today I had an appt with my GP so he could make sure I was okay. Well I wasn't okay. He said he cares about me and wants to see me happy again and not in this state. He said he would be very hurt if i did something to myself. I was sitting there, head down not really paying attention to what he was saying. I don't care anymore. I told him I had a plan and we talked about it and now he wants me to see a psychiatrist. And i said no because i don't want to talk about the same stuff over and over again. And then he'll probably give me more medication which i don't want. I told him why can't he just send me away somewhere and he said I am not at that point of being admitted into hospital. But he wants me to see someone. I told him i can't because then i will lose my therapist and i don't want to lose him as i am comfortable with him. But actually last night in session we talked about how bad i thought my depression is and he said i probably should see a psychiatrist as well. Can i see a psych for one visit or do i have to keep going back and now with less hours at work which means less money i don't think i can afford seeing a psych. What are UID1518 going to do anyway? I'm not in a very good frame of mind at the moment, my GP wants me to stay busy all weekend and I have to go back on Tuesday to see him. My GP said that my husband is at fault to a point because he doesn't want to acknowledge my depression and doesn't speak to me about it. I know he wants it all to be perfect but it's not perfect. So that was my day today, I am exhausted and fragile at the same time. These thoughts are horrible. Jo"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
So messed up,UID1885,This year has started not so well. A friend dumped me last year. UID2181 it's happened again. I just very upset and UID1183 right now. I'm trying to get positive.

But I understand that's your personal journey &amp; in no way do I want to intrude. That leaves me with a reference to -as you mentioned , he is going through a difficult time &amp; I am guessing there are many other issues he has to deal with that we are unaware of. I was thinking of him this morning &amp; how many people he replies to &amp; offers support-I may be completely wrong-but I do wonder if by filling his time with other people's problems that he then has no time to confront his own issues. He is brilliant at supporting &amp; advising others, but perhaps it's time to look after his well being first. I have such fondness for him &amp; have left mags for him in his last two posts which I hope he gets. I really wish we could talk on phone or email or something. I know I'll be thinking of  all day &amp; it's hard when the forum is a slow place for reading, receiving &amp; posting messages. But yet the forum is brilliant as its probably the most advanced method of communication re mental health. As for me, the acute team want me to see a UID372egistrar Pyschiatrist at a public hospital tomorrow. Has anyone had any experience with psychs in public hospitals? I'm a bit worried I'm going from the frying pan (my private pysch) to the fire (public mental health system). I have asked that my private pysch &amp;" GP not be informed of the present situation as I want the space to explore options without feeling guilty. The acute team said UID1518 will find out if it has to be disclosed. My husband has his narrow mind determined that the sole problem is being caused by the use of one medication I started nearly 4 was ago. And has said to me """"he is sick &amp";" tired of trying to UID1059 me as I don't take his advice"""" -meaning not take the prescribed medication. But whilst I &amp";" the acute team agree I need a medication review-UID1518 also said that no medication would cause my current state of mind four weeks after I started it. If I was to react this badly it would have happened at the start or early stages ie first week of me taking the medication. And the acute team were shocked he had left me with kids in this state-when I spoke to him last night to ask him to please read a little bit about depression, his reply was that I could harm myself whether he was UID3760 or not so what was the point of taking time off work to come home when I was in this state-he said he couldn't do anything to fix it so he was angry the acute team thought he should be with me at this time. He barely reacted to the acute team coming (even though he has previously trained in social work) which surprised me as before he left I asked him are there any services that can come to your house? And his reply was that mental health services are so under resourced that acute teams are only for people who are either seriously ill with conditions such as Schitzophenia or people who are seriously ill. He immediately followed that statement by saying 'there's no way an acute team would ever visit someone like you, you aren't unwell enough"""". So off he went to NZ telling me I'd be fine &amp";" that the only thing he would finally say on the matter was """" you know what I think &amp";" you've chosen to ignore my advice so there's nothing more I can say or do about the situation""""- he was referring to his """"advice"""" to stop the stimulant medication. I don't know if its just me being negative but it hurt that the only reason he saw for coming home was because of safety issues &amp"; he thought harm could occur whether he was UID3760 or not. But what stood out to me was that he hadn't considered coming home in terms of providing care, compassion &amp; loving support. He hadn't considered that being with me would be a natural thing to do when your partner is seriously ill. He hadn't thought that being UID3760 would provide me with company, support, compassion &amp; make me feel loved &amp; reassured. I guess it was like a complete lack of emotion in response to my situation &amp; that hurt. He is home tonight (Thursday) &amp; goes back to NZ on UID3355day. In some ways given his response to what I'm going through-I am feeling anxious about him coming home for a few days &amp;" would now really prefer he didn't. As whilst he is UID3760 he will criticise me for not following his advice, he will make comments such as """"he is completely over this situation) &amp"; he will not talk WITH me, he will talk at me &amp; I get very anxious when he is in that frame of mind &amp; given how fragile I am now, the last thing I need or want is he tring to intervene &amp; overtake things-for example when I go to visit pysch tomorrow I'm sure he will want to tell his opinion. Oh-update-he just phoned &amp; said why are you going to see a pyschiatrist at the hospital-psychs that work in public health are hopeless. Great support-just what I needed to hear. Things are really hard, I'm just managing to get through each day &amp;" now I'm going to have to deal with him. Anxious just thinking about him. Je is due at 5pm tonight. I will be very anxious. Does anyone have any advice or knowledge or experience of Pyschiatrists on an Acute Mental Health team? Thanks x Mares x"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Crisis Point,UID3332,""Hi all, I just wrote a short post in my post called'Monsters in my head'. Then I realised I'm sitting UID3760 alone feeling almost too ashamed to come UID3760 &amp"; talk to you guys so I should do it. I am feeling incredibly low. I feel like I've been overtaken my misery, sadness, loss &amp; feel like a hopeless failure. The past 2 nights I've gone to bed so relieved the day is over &amp; hoping I won't wake up. When I wake in the morning I'm full of dread &amp; fear &amp; severe anxiety. As I mentioned, I could clearly write my own will the state I'm in. I'm so tired of the battles with this illness, the effects on my family &amp; their responses to me. All I can see is a future spend struggling for other people &amp; me not being active or happy during any of it. And it terrifies me the way depression can sometimes just overcome me &amp; I don't know why. Like last week I was good &amp; I managed to have a whole week at home by myself. When I was crying UID1861 about how scared I was of these thoughts that seemed to be coming from nowhere &amp; overwhelming me, I said to my husband what do I do when I get this low? And his reply was 'ring your pyschiatrist'. UID2181 if I ring her in this state she will only be concerned about me &amp; will probably suggest hospital or if I explain how I'm truly feeling she will admit me I think. She never has as she knows I have insight &amp; my kids are my safety net. But if she did admit me my husband would flip out as he is travelling for work the next two weeks &amp; we have no support to UID1059 us with kids or in a crisis. I feel like my heart is actually physically aching but I can only shed a few tears. Although if someone hit a trigger I'd probably cry for ages. I'm so over this struggle, I'm over having an illness that's still not socially acceptable in the general community. I'm tired of fighting the darkness, doing all the things that are supposed to UID1059 &amp; ending up UID3760. I'm only 40 &amp; the last 10 years have just been one long battle with my illness &amp; mu husbands leukaemia. I'm so genuinely frightened of the thoughts that are popping into my head. I'm so alone &amp; desperate. I have a GP &amp;" Pysch who just prescribe medication. I feel like I'm drowning and I just want reassurance I won't drown or if I do that it's the best outcome.

"The sad conveyor belt of life,UID3556,""Hi I feel washed out. UID3981l so incredibly tired. Yet I think that I get an appropriate amount of sleep. I do dream every night and UID1518 range from some being ok ones to some not so flash ones. Last night was one of the not so flash ones! UID50023 But this cycle just continues on and I’m sick of this. The conveyor belt of life … on and on it goes, chug chug chug along … the same mundane, boring, monotonous journey, punctuated by the odd injury UID3760 and there. And you know what else … I sit for the most part with a scowl or sorrow etched on my face. It’s amazing, I can’t cry, but I can’t laugh either. I used to be able too. (Oh crap, I finished this message and was going to send, but started to re-read the damn thing and have started to add more stuff! I’ll send this thing now!) I don’t know what it is … I still go to the gym 5 days a week and the other two days I still do some kind of exercise, which is always of a late arve and I amazingly have energy and enthusiasm for that. My mornings of late are becoming a major struggle. I do get up and get out of bed each day (yes, I know that’s a positive) and I do get to work. I’m having less sick days than I used to during late last year"; but that’s only because my sick day credits are quite low. I feel like I’m whining to you all and I HATE that. I’m just so sick of all this. My eyes just want to close and I think my body wants to do the same thing. I’m getting worse as time goes by … and all I feel is that by me being this way it HAS to affect my family – my beloved kids and I don’t want them to see me like this and I don’t want them to possibly fall foul of this evil rotten disease. I go to my GP and he’s really caring, but at the end of it, he just asks, “What would you like me to do?” I go to my psychiatrist and at the end he says, “The best thing we can do is to get you a different or a new job.” (But that’s so much easier said than done … the current job climate where I am is ‘below zero’ and little sign of it thawing out for a while yet. So if one has a job, one has to hold onto it in order to get paid. The dreaded money curse again. But I had 9 months off last year and I’m back UID3760 again and it’s just doing my head in – the other people UID3760 – I think I’ve now developed some sort of phobia about them. It’s not everyone – there’s just five of them – and UID1518’re as cliquey a group as you can get … but it’s their voices that irritate me, their bangles that slap against the desk when UID1518 type … and UID1518 bag people out … mostly men and mostly their other halves. Oh jeez, listen to me … whinge whinge, ***** *****!) Not good . I do have my psychologist appointment coming up – don’t know if I’ve mentioned this before, but can you believe it;" of all the days it has to be on, it’s on the day at coincides with the day that I couldn’t save my brother and I lost him – lost him forever and from there, the family commenced its demise … due to yours truly. But then again, as I’ve written before, my brother’s anniversary - 13th Feb - and Dad’s anniversary (what a stupid name association that is for the day that someone dies) – UID1518 don’t actually make me feel sadder – because I grieve for them everyday. It’s a bit like the old Valentine’s Day syndrome … people go nutso because of a particular date and buy flowers, roses, presents etc … just because of a stupid date – why can’t you buy flowers, roses, presents, etc on ANY day during the year? People have become so … sheep like I think. I guess this is where I differ … at least I’m not sheep like. My partner knows never to expect anything on Valentine’s Day, cause I go against the trend and I buy flowers, etc at different times throughout the year. Much better that way … far more special … as it comes as a massive surprise as opposed to something UID1518 are going to expect. Oh shite – this was just meant to be a small post just to get some feelings down and to send it off, but I have this stupid thing in my brain that I cannot ever seem to post a short message. I don’t know why, although I think I do … it’s a feeling of insecurity. I’m insecure about everything about myself – it’s a weakness. All the time while typing this, I have very close to falling asleep and it’s what, 8:40am. That’s it I guess … well actually, that’s not it … there’s so much more, I’ve barely touched the surface there, but for the moment, that’s it.  ps: thanx for reading, and special kudos if you got all the way through."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Scared to be Honest,UID1152,""Hi all tomorrow is my long awaited psych appointment and to say I am anxious is like saying it's just a tad warm! OMG. I have been reading all your posts and find myself 1/ in awe of your inspiring messages and 2/ feeling crap that I complain about my petty issues. So I thought I would run my plan of attack by you. I have set myself a list of goals I want to achieve this year, e.g stop meds lose weight,. accept my depression, etc I am going to ask my psych to UID1059 of course and the only condition is no emotional talk. Ok I know that sounds stupid but I am telling you I am so full of conflicting emotions all the time I can't cope. Once we get started on the whys I just lose it. I don't know if I will ever really deal with my issues, but at least if I don't talk about them I can somehow muddle through. I just need to be told what to do and I will do it. Just get me from A to B. Is that too hard? Believe me if I go to doc tomorrow and talk to him like I've been talking to you guys, he will lock me up and throw away the key! In fact if I was completely honest I don't think I've ever told him everything that I've been feeling, for exactly that reason. I am scared to be completely honest about my feelings in case I get locked up again. That's why this site is a good release. Sometimes you just have to have a rant and get it out there without thoughts of reprisals. ( in fairness I had an extensive history and gave plenty of reasons to admit me) . So I will try and focus now and maybe add to my list ( number 55) cheers Stressless"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Self medicating - help please,UID1152,""Hi Guys I have spent a lot of time on line the last couple of days as I am having a bad time. it is raining and I always find the rain makes me worse.

"My Journey,UID1277,""My journey so far has been an up and down ride, like a roller coaster. It started last yr in early August when i was admitted to hospital,I stayed in hospital for approx 5 or 6 days. After i was released it was very tough, very emotional. my feelings were all over the place, as time has gone on and as i have made connections my training of thoughts anf feelings have become more common and i am not having as bad times as i was before. The thoughts that i get now are just a little bit of loneliness occasionally. Even though i am still in my early stages compared to other people that i have made connections with, i can notice a change in the way i'm thinking and my thoughts. It is with the UID1059 of everyone UID3760 at Beyond Blue and many other support sites and people that i have been able to move forward along my pathway. I still have a long way to go but i can very much see the change that i have made since last August. I have been having a feeling inside me like something was missing and i now know what I was missing as the feeling has gone, I was missing a girlfriend. I have just met her and we have so much in common and are so much in love with eachother. To each and everyone of you UID3760 on this forum i say thankyou for all of your kind, caring,supporting, inspiring thoughts and messages.

"Are there different levels of depression?,UID3556,""Hi all, and to all, I say """"hi"""" In another post our dear friend  in part of one of his sentences wrote about """"levels of depression"""". And it was excellent, because it got me thinking. How do we explain the different levels of depression and indeed, ARE there different levels of depression? If there are, then the rest of my below vent isn't needed, and the only thing it will have done will be to continue to exercise my fingers as UID1518 tap away at the glorious keyboard in front of me. So vent commencing now: I'm diagnosed with chronic depression. But what if someone else is diagnosed with depression with no word of 'chronic' in front of it. Are UID1518 better off than me? Am I chronically more worse off than them? I would answer """"no"""" to both questions. And you know for the first time, I've never even questioned that. """"Look if someone has depression, UID1518 have depression Doc"""". Or am I being blase/silly UID3760, and there are levels of depression";" hence: """"we have someone who comes in and has these kinds of issues, so we'll label this person with """"garden variety depression"""" and then we have someone coming in who is presenting all these kinds of things, and so instead of being just in the garden, this person is at the top of the tree, with chronic depression"""". You know, now that I've actually written this out I think I have got the answer and perhaps it IS """"yes"""". When I've had my mental health plan done with my GP (3 of them now), there is a series of questions you have to answer and I think this is something called the K10 test"; 10 questions and if you answer them and get the score of 10, you are fine and healthy, not a problem with you (although you may have an ingrown toe-nail, but that's for another website to be concerned with) and off you go on your merry way. 50 is the absolute worst and you can't get a higher score than that and I believe that would mean immediate hospitalisation. The first time I did the test, I scored 32. Not good, but definitely not terrible. I was still UID1183, but not acute. A year ago I did the test and I was 42. Much worse and nowhere near good and closing in on the not good side. In December I did the test and I scored 45. Very bad and things remain to be so. My point UID3760 is, perhaps something over 40 would be labelled as being chronic depression and anything between, oh I don't know, 25 to 40 would be depressive symptoms. Gee, I can waffle ... but it does UID1059 you know ... if you just cannot talk to others due to this illness, it does UID1059 to be able to write things down. And for years I've done this with creating a journal about my thoughts ... but now I've found Beyond Blue and these wonderful forum sites, I can just type away to my heart is, as UID1518 say in the classics, content. I'm sure that most people will see that it's another post from me and will bypass it, simply cause otherwise, that'll be 15-20 mins of their life UID1518 won't get back having had to trawl through the tripe that I tend to post. But that's ok ... cause I've read it ... just the once and it is kinda therapeutic. Are there different levels of depression? Ok, now I believe there are. But only after comprehensive scientific research had been conducted, as you'll have noticed from above. ;") Over and out, "",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Big bad monsters in head,UID3332,""Dear all I am having an awful morning. I woke up feeling really emotional & don't know why. My husband woke up shortly after & I could tell he was upset. He said I don't communicate anymore as I shutdown & isolate myself & he feels like he is living alone. He criticised my medication, my Drs & my wish to talk about Beyond Blue. He said he'd had enough suffering. I asked if he would read about depression and he said why would he read it when he lives with it everyday. He was harsh & angry. I wanted to explain to him that if he read material he might be more compassionate & hopeful. Sometimes I think he must believe I enjoy all this. Can't he see I'm in pain hurting, not knowing where my mind will end up next? I'd do anything to stop my thoughts & experience happiness. I spent $200 I didn't have on Selfhelp books the past few weeks. I'm trying so so hard. And I took my son out as promised UID1861 & spoilt him even though I didn't feel like it-I forced myself for him. Then I got home and rarely does this happen, but I was overwhelmed to end it all. But my safety net is my kids & I don't think I could ever do that to them. This morning I'm so overwrought with emotion and want to never stop the tears but I can only feel them flow softly down my face. ( I want to cry & cry like you but I can't). It's not going to be a good day by the way things are going. I need to find myself somehow. For those that don't know-I left home at 19 & moved into a share house of young people. Until then I had been supporting my mum who had breast cancer & 2 younger sisters. I stayed that long as my Dad had abused me & I waited until he left before I did. My self worth/esteem was so low I thought that the first person to show me any form of love &/or affection I'd stick with. So at 19 I married a guy in that house & we still together today although we've endured so much with my illness. His leukaemia & issues with kids. Anyway today I feel really sad. My husband is so angry I'm only seeing Drs/Psychiatrists who prescribe more medication each visit. My Pysch knows my history & says I have PTSD, trauma. Severe anxiety & chronic depression. She said I will always live with the pain but hopefully come to accept it as a chapter of my life & move on to the next chapter. Don't you hate those days you get up & could start crying before you hit the bathroom. It's a roller coaster. I like GA mentioned in a previous post hate the fear of not knowing what's going to hit me when. I feel I'm a hopeless, unmotivated, unfuctionaning, wreck of a person who used to be so bright & fun & happy & loveable.

"Today is not a good day,UID905,""The past two days have been ok. I have alternated between a sober mood and a manic ones. I literally could not sit down two evenings ago. My mind would not stop racing. Thoughts chasing thoughts, around around my head. Yesterday afternoon, I couldn't stop laughing. Half the things weren't even funny. Last night there was some little comment or other- something incredibly petty and I was just suddenly so angry at my husband. It made no sense. This morning I am torn between wanting to punch walls and cry in a corner. If only I could control this. I don't necessarily want to jump off my rollercoaster ride but riight now I want to bash my hands against the safety railing. There's got to be something better than this awful state. There's got to be a way out. I am not winning against the monsters in my head today. One of them has me swallowed whole and I don't know when he's going to spit me out.

"Climbing out of my skin,UID1152,""Hi All, It's been a beautiful day in the sun and for a while there I felt normal. Until I remembered I'm not. I am a drug abuser and suffer from depression. It is almost 4 years ago since so my first hospitalisation and yet it seems like UID1861. The same fear, shame , anxiety and the overwhelming sadness I felt at having been reduced to that state washes over me still when I am feeling particularly low. How did it happen I ask myself over and over. UID2181 after years of therapy and four more admissions I still have these feelings. I still feel bad!. One good thing in hospital was the shared feelings and camaraderie you tend to develop with fellow sufferers after a few months. I joined BB to UID1059 fill that gap and the support has been good but part of me says I don't want to be in this 'club ' anymore. Is it just me ? I don't want to have my GP and Psych on speed dial. I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on meds that make me fat and stupid. And I really don't want that tag hanging around my neck forever of 'someone that needs to watched '( """"you know because of what she did"""") I have been waiting to see my psych for a month due to Christmas etc and I am climbing out of my skin. It's never over. No matter how much better you become or how you seemingly get back to normal. You are not allowed to forget, ever! It's great that people from BB are going on TV, I'm all for it and if it UID1059s make the subject less taboo then that's wonderful. But the reality for those of us living with depression is that we face discrimination, lack of understanding. and rejection on a daily basis and more often than not it's not from strangers but people we know and love. I want my family and friends to """"get it"""", but the problem is I agree with most of the misconceptions out there. I loathe myself for what I've become and the friends and money I've lost. I can't give them back this time. I can't make it better. So all I can do is to try to make myself less loathsome and carry on. This is where the meds UID1059. But then................................ Yep I hate myself all over again for being so weak.

"Dark depths of despair - it won't go away,UID3556,""Me of late … well it’s so hard to put into words. I know a lot of you have been asking over the last little while. I’m just so incredibly sad. Just so low. And then it makes me angry … with myself and sometimes it borders to others as well. Not that I want to do any harm to anyone, but it’s just so difficult to express. Just over the last couple of days, what I think I’m realising is that I’m still in heavy mourning and still overcome with grief from the loss of my brother and my Dad. And it’s a long time to be coping with this … 1991 for my bro and 2007 for my Dad. But I kind of feel like why should I be happy when UID1518’re no longer UID3760. I feel that why should I get any enjoyment out of anything"; cause Dad and my bro aren’t UID3760 anymore to enjoy such things. Even more so for my brother, cause he was just 29 when I lost him. But yeah, it’s sometimes like it’s in the days after the funeral, where everyone else is getting on with their lives and I think, “to hell with that … I can’t and won’t live properly – I’m going to continue to feel sad, because I have too. UID794 else does this, f**k everyone else, I’m going to feel sad for them forever and I’ll show it to everyone”. And all the while, I’m just wasting away my life … and am worried every day that my kids will be ok, that UID1518 will turn out alright. This low, awful feeling has been with me for so long now … and it’s really getting to me you know. I see my Doc, I see my psychiatrist, my meds have been reviewed;" I have recently had another mental health check and that proved that yes, I am definitely not a normal functioning human being … I’m just … I can’t … anyway, UID1518’ve got me a series of appointments with my psychologist, but the first one isn’t for another month yet. I exercise every day, we have pets at home which are great, by the way … and yet I still feel this low. This unbelievable sadness that is ripping the absolute guts out of me. You know, I’m on UID3760 every day and I reply to all sorts of different folks … wonderful folks … but all the time, you’re hearing these posts from someone who is among their lowest ebbs in life. I can’t do anything to end my life … I couldn’t and won’t do that to my beautiful family. For as much torture and hell that I live through every day, if I did that, it would destroy them. For anyone else who might be reading this … if you’re at that particular way of thinking … please think of the people you’d be hurting so badly who would be left. I know we have these thoughts and how nice it’d be to not wake up again, but we can’t do this. I’ve mentioned that we have the demons, the torture, the living hell inside our minds every day … but there’s nothing for it … despite doing you know “all the right things that UID1518 say you should do”, I still am no better. I’m clearly getting worse. So there we are, we are just a under-performing, under-achieving (whoops, sorry, that should have said I am) ……………………….. I want to scream out, I want to cry, but I can’t do the latter and I’d frighten everyone in this workplace if I did the former. I can’t even think of anything funny to say.

My facial expression that i feel tells me something is wrong, i feel a worried look on my face. I look out my window and into the bright light of the suns rays and i think what is missing, before everything started back in August of last yr i was in a similar life position and i felt gd but now that i have gone through what i have i feel something left me when i got admitted to hospital in August and since then i have been trying to get back what left me. Why can't i see the qualities in myself and yet other people can? I see them sometimes but most of the time i'm just so oblivious to them like i'm blinded by everything else that is going on in my life that i some how don't recognise my qualities. Is it because my head is full of other things e.g. peoples names, appointments etc. I've felt like this for a couple of days now. Have been doing other things to take my mind of it but in the end it all comes back to the same place. It doesn't disappear it just lays dormant for a couple of hours then comes back in a slow and yet powerful way.

"will i ever get better,UID3739,""I don't know if I will ever get better. Whether this damn depression that eats away at me will disappear. Whether my anxiety levels will drop. Will I ever have self esteem or confidence? Will I ever lose weight or be strong? There are so many scenarios and questions that I can't answer. Today I feel sort of okay. I went for a 6km walk with my hubby this morning and now my legs are sooo sore. Sitting on my deck in the sunshine listening to the birds whistling away among the trees I feel free but scared. I still have so much trepidation where it concerns my parents. And I don't have any self esteem, in fact I hate myself so much"; I hate the way I look, my body, the weight I have put on from the anti depressants and the lack of confidence. I struggle daily even though I work (that's when I put on a mask). I still wonder about self harm, still wonder what's it like to go to hospital. I am scared that I may never get this depression out of my head, my body, me. I am scared that it will be with me forever. It's hard to not be scared when the thoughts pop up about self harming and suicide come up. Do I just keep taking the meds forever. I asked my psych UID1861 if I could come off them and his reply was that talking to my parents now wouldn't solve the depression instantly. So that means that i have to keep taking them. Sorry guys, I am just not understanding depression, I thought I knew what it was but i don't think i really do. Was I born with it; did i develop it as I got older;" is it a chemical imbalance? Will I ever get better - I guess time will tell. Jo"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"New Year,............ ,UID1015,""Happy New year to all my Beyond Blue Friends!!! I hope that through all your daily struggles you managed to feel some happiness and positive energy throughout the festive season!! I haven't written in such a long time and for that I feel guilty and sorry!! You've all supported me alot and I feel as if I have been selfish! Never the less, UID3760 I go!! If i were to reflect truthfully and entirely on my last year I would be a ball of tears, fears and sadness! So I'll keep it brief. It sucked major Donkeys..... Depression.... Other health issues, simply not coping with my everyday life, very nearly destroyed a lot of relationships in my life and my will to get better and try to carry on a strong healthy happy person. Christmas day its self was a near on disaster, an event Christmas eve most def ruined my Christmas and I can say that it was a turning point in my head and in my heart!! I decided to try my very hardest and put all my effort into staying positive!! So far so good!! UID2181 I know it seems so smug of me to say it but I am proud of my achievement so far!!! Its hard, and very very trying, but Im not giving up. I put a shield up and when I get those feelings of that sneaky black dog creeping up to rock me, I bang bang deflect all the bad vibes and think of something thats making me happy!!! Naturally I still have moments, but I'm just trying not to dwell on those moments! I got a promotion at work, my relationship seems to be blossoming even more so, This is all good and I feel appreciated and respected! Its going well!! Plus I no longer have to work away so i think thats a pretty big chunk of my problems about to go away!! My biggest struggle at the moment is small and its my weight, I know its only a minor issue but its mine!! I'm 25 172-175 cm tall and I weigh 57kg, just before Christmas i was 55kg and thats where I want to be, so Im doing it!! I often get down about my weight and realistically I know I have nothing to worry about Im not fat or over weight, im closer to underweight than I am over weight but it is a strange little thing always on my mind! I wear baggy clothes so I feel smaller!! I watch what I eat. But its nothing major so Im feeling positive about life again!! So I want to thank all of you have had UID1059ed me through the hard times, and to everyone who is struggling over whatever just remember that no problem is stupid, your not alone and thongs will get better. Dont ever give up. :) xxxx LP"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"seeing my psych today,UID3739,""Hi everyone Can't wait for 12 noon when I see my psych. It's been 10 days since my last session but it feels like forever. So much has happened in the past week that it's doing my head in. I thought that me seeing my parents would UID1059 me feel a lot happier. But I'm not and I now know that it's the depression, the chemical imbalance that is affecting me. So what do I do? Keep taking my meds, keep seeing my psych and GP, exercising, doing stuff that I can do. Maybe in my head I thought I would be """"fixed"""" """"cured"""" when I saw my parents. But that's not the case. Not at all. In fact part of me feels like I am heading downhill again. Is it the emotions. It has to be - the roller coaster of emotions I've had this week. I've had to deal with so much this week that I really don't know how I coped - well I'm not that's the point. You know, I craved for my parents for three years, I cried every day for them"; and then it turned to my dad. I wanted to see him but couldn't, i wanted a hug from him but couldn't. And then last week I got the hug I so much wanted. I have a feeling this is going to take a long time for me to be happy again, thing is will I ever be happy again? I try, i really do try to be the best wife, mum, daughter, sister, friend. I really do but sometimes I don't know. I doubt myself so much, I have high expectations of myself, i can't make mistake, i can't fail. And I have - because I have depression, I have a mental illness. So where to from UID3760 - I don't have a clue. All I know is that my parents are speaking to me, I lost my last grandparent the other day; i struggle to work, i struggle to be happy. I don't know anymore. I hope by being on UID3760 I can gain some strength to keep going, because some days it's not easy; some days it's hard. I know I have a lot of friends on UID3760 now that we support each other; and i hope that UID3800, if anyway possible, we could all UID3584t up - i would just love to hug everyone and say thanks. Thanks for keeping me alive, thanks for keeping me strong and thanks for picking me up when I'm down. (wiping me eyes with tissue). I really and truly believe that BB is a fantastic and safe site to use;" we all understand each other and know what we're going through. I think I'm rambling on now, so I will go. Let you all know how my session goes today - though I'm thinking it won't be great, I'll need tissues. Jo xx"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Trying to Help People,UID1277,""This friday evening. I like most other times when i have started a new thread or post am laying on my bed listening to music on my phone. This thread is quite similar to the """"A must UID372ead Thread"""". It is all about trying to UID1059 others who a in a real dark patch at the moment and those you need to read some encouraging, supporting and inspiring words. It is to give us all on UID3760 at BB a pick up off the ground, so we can all walk together hand in hand with one another. For people who are in a really dark place, i understand your feelings we all do you are not alone and never wil be. I am hoping that this thread will bring people who are struggling out of the shadows of darkness and into the light of the sun. It is when this happens that you start to notice that things are changing for the better. I know what it is like to go to hell and back, you feel like nothing or no one can UID1059 but in the end it all comes together i assure you all. This is my own way of trying to UID1059 others, it is not because i don't want to post on anyone's thread it is simply that the best way for me to UID1059 people is to create threads like this turn the negative into a positive.

"Acknowledgement to ,UID3556,""To , I've been thinking of doing this post for a while now and so thought today is as good a day to do it as any. Can I just say that the experience, advice and support that  brings to this site is incredible. We know you’ve had your long ride through hell … just as most of us are experiencing ourselves right now. Your journey was damn long and though you’re through now, I know there are times that demons come back to haunt you. As I’ve referenced in the past, you have been the one constant on this site for the whole time and that’s evidenced by the incredibly high number of posts that you’ve sent. Over 1,500 posts provided to people in need, people in crisis, people crying out for UID1059, for support ... people like us … you’ve responded and sent replies to so many and you have made a difference. A HUGE difference. I would hazard a guess that you have saved untold amount of lives by your support and advice when people were at their lowest ebb and about to end things. Things like this just emphasis to me just how amazing and truly special you are . I’m sorry if I’ve gone all fuzzy and warm with this post and have singled  out specially (because for anyone who comes on UID3760 and posts responses – UID1518 are responses of support, care, advice and love – love for the other people who are suffering – and everyone should be acknowledged for being such wonderful, kind spirited, compassionate and the absolute best human beings on this planet). But I just wanted to say a quick thank you to  for his constant advice, knowledge and unwavering support. Thanx mate and UID3800 if we ever UID3584t, I would love to shake your hand, buy you a beer and sit and have a few frosty ones with you. Cheers  Ps: I really don’t know what bought that on … it’s 10:36am, so that must have been one helluva coffee that I had this morning!

"My Day,UID905,""You are probably of sick of hearing from me by now, but I felt the need to post what happened to me today. After a long and ardous 5 hour long conversation with my husband UID1861, I decided that I was going to go to this convention today which we have UID1059ed plan for the past month. It was a small one- not even a thousand people but a couple of days ago I was sure I would be too fragile to face that. I wasn't even sure gioing to sleep last night. I woke up this morning and decided to to go. I would be volunteering close to my husband and some friends so if things tarted to go pear shaped, UID1059 was at hand to seek medical attention. The deal was we would be there as long as I could stand it and then we could go home or to the hopsital depending on my state of mind. It went alot better than expected. I spent most of the day there and even found the responsibility of looking after attendees UID1059ed me keep my mind of my troubles. I just focused on what others needed. When the crowd was toomuch, I withdrew to a spot working the door where it was quieter and I didn't even have to do much work. The biggest news of all- I had fun. I laughed for the first time in days. I found myself smiling. Today was a good day. I am not saying I won't have bad days after this, I probably will with the looming deadline of deciding what to do with my life now that I have wasted 7 years on a not quite finished degree. I haven't even began to deal with my family issues. But today was a good day all the same. I guess that's what the point of this post is- not to gloat that I am having a good day and others aren't, but that good days can and do happen. A good day happened to me of all people, and if you've been following my posts you know good days just haven't been happening for months. If I had quit before this, I wouldn't have seen today. I see the stars I was looking for. By gum, if good days can happen to me UID1518 can happen to you too. The second point is when the dark comes again for me and I can't see the stars, you out there can throw this day back in my face. You have full permission to do that. You can rub my face in this feeling until it scrubs out all the darkness and I see stars again. UID2181 more importantly, how did your day go?

I have tried so hard to put all of my crap behind me and re- enter the workforce primarily and then hopefully the human race again- but no-one will give me a go. Before my injury 9 years ago at work which then spiralled into drug addiction, depression, suicide attempts and hospitalisation, I was a force to be reckoned with. I was top of my career and was seen as the go to gal . I set all kinds of records in my chosen career and was a confident , self assured strong lady. 3 years after my injury I was let go from my employer as I could no longer do the job required. I have spent the last 6 months applying for jobs. Initially in my chosen field then anything I thought I could do. I am registered on every job site available and spend hours scanning the work available. Unfortunately the process now of applying on- line may be user friendly for the employer, but it doesn't give the applicant a fair go. A lot of the employers want you to take an 'intelligence test' first ( you know square pegs round holes stuff) , multiple choice scenarios etc. If you pass this round then it's something else again. You're very lucky to get an interview. I used to recruit people in my line of work all the time and I never solely relied on someone's application and / or personal information. I relied on my gut instinct and the employee's experience and presence. All jobs now ask OH&S questions. Can you lift certain weights, bend, stand , do somersaultsUID50007? I had a back injury. I had surgeries. As soon as I mention a prior condition forget it. If I have to say it was workers comp then that's a double whammy and I will never hear back. Do I lie to get a job? What happens then if I can't lift a box or climb a ladder? I need to work. I need to be part of something again and feel important. My self esteem is at rock bottom and with each passing day I am losing that drive to move on . It has take me a very long time to get to this point and I am so scared I am going to go back to where I was. I am still on prescription meds and the temptation to self medicate is very real. Today I am having a """" I don't care day"""" I stayed in bed late, didn't walk the dog and couldn't care less about what's for dinner. I am losing my motivation. I have done all the courses, read all the books I know what I am supposed to do. But I have tried time and time again. God UID1059 me I am so tired of this ****.

"I'm so over life,UID372,""I'm sick of this thing called life. I have done so much for my family over the years and all I have in return is a resume that won't get me a job. I haven't been in a relationship for years and can't find anyone who is actually interested in me. I'm 30 and don't have children, medically unable to and yet in my culture it is extremely important for women to have children. I see everyone around me settling down with partners, having children, good jobs, a house and car. I have none of that and it pushes me further down into the depression hole. I have the kind of family that won't let go of me, allow me to establish my life, every time I try and get away, UID1518 pull me back into their toxic web.

I immediately start to panic. I open the letter and it is informing me that DHS Child Protection will no longer have anything to do with my family Surely that is a good thing, that the magistrate will take into account? Im finally starting to see some light at the end of this long dark tunnel. Finally, am i starting to get some small results from the work i have been doing? But then my pessimistic side decided to chime in. She told my mum DHS made her take out the IVO. DHS are no longer concerned, and she hasnt retracted it.

"Me & how r u? (5/1/14),UID3332,""Hi all I've been thinking of many of you so I thought I'd start this thread for those who want to share &amp"; support each other today. I'm also having technical difficulty replying to posts so I'm not sure if its just me or a broader problem. I am alone this week-kids &amp; husband in Melbourne. My pysch wanted me to make this a special wk I focused on myself &amp; things I enjoyed but I'm struggling with that as usually I stay in house &amp; avoid things. I have got some gift vouchers so I could go shops? I have been brave &amp; contacted an old friend, a retiree who also suffered depression &amp; he gave up on calling me as I never responded so I called him &amp; we are having lunch tomorrow. So that's two activities or two days taken care of. Today I might read &amp; hang out. Tues friend coming. We'd shops with vouchers. UID2181 the dilemma-my mum wants to go a shopping outlet on Thursday which is just a big UID3827 of discontinued items &amp; then stay at her house. But my family return Friday night so I'd like to be UID3760 Friday to make house nice. I sound pathetic, minor issues-the real issues are the. Big anxiety battle I'm experiencing &amp; having no one to talk to about that. Anyway that's me. Please update me if you can? Worried about some of you. And without any intention of leaving anyone out -, Jo, , UID3808 -I haven't been able to respond due to computer problems. But I'm also thinking of , GA, stress less, Suz. , , , 'what's the point, 'lost' &amp; all those on this forum who I care for &amp; think of each day. Anxiety &amp; depression can completely invade our lives &amp; like the discussion I read btw , UID3808 &amp; -it has completely changed my relationship &amp; although I'm sure my husband loves me-I also know if it wasn't for the kids he would have left years ago. He often says my illness has destroyed any happiness in his life &amp;" after his recent battle with leukaemia-I'm heartbroken to be a """"burden"""". I want him to have a good life as he has a rare form of leukaemia &amp"; only 25% of people survive 5 yrs. he has made nearly 3. He has a top specialist who isn't dramatic but is frank &amp; honest &amp; has told us my husbands leukaemia is extremely rare in adults &amp; we have to accept that bone marrow treatments for him would almost definitely not work &amp; it would be a matter of making him comfortable. He could try one more round of treatment but if/when the leukaemia comes back it will go straight to his brain, spine &amp; bones so no real hope. It's called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Shortly before that I think I mentioned that my father who abused me committed syicide &amp; that was devastating as he had left me a short note. And he died a lonely, homeless alcoholic living on the street drinking metho. I had compassion for him in the end-I wasn't afraid anymore-I saw him as a very sick, weak, UID1183 &amp; desperate man who had nothing but inner turmoil that he couldn't live with. I've had awful bouts of depression where I can't face getting up &amp; deciding what clothes to wear. Where I won't leave house &amp; stay in Pjs for days not able to talk. It's terrible illness. But sometimes the anxiety feels worse-it puts thoughts in my head that I'm hopeless &amp; can't do things. It keeps me stuck in one place. It makes my adrenalin levels on such high alert that I'm ready to jump through the window at any unexpected noise. My stomach is in knots &amp; I forget to breathe normally. My body-shoulders &amp; hands are clenched. It has a voice that invades my mind. It's a terrible thing to live with &amp; one that no one I know understands or will read about-despite me getting them information. Oh gosh-this was meant for others to write about their day-I'm sorry-I really hope you can &amp; you do. You are each in my thoughts.

"LIFE,UID1277,""I sit on my bed listening to a cd, i think about life and all the emotions and experiences people have during their own lives. We have ups and downs we get pulled sideways downwards and upwards but in the end we always come back to the same spot the middle. I think of how people can be nice, caring friends and people in general and yet these same people can also be qiute the opposite. I had that experience UID1861 with one of my friends. I was UID1059ing clean a friends house with her and then at approx 6.30pm we had a disagreement which then quickly turned into an argument. We have friends come and go throughout our lives, we have different homes we live in and different cars but their is one thing that we cannot replace and should not replace that being our own immediate families. We have our sibling squabbles, i certainly did with my sisters me being the youngest and only boy. I got up to mischief, followed dad up the ladder to the roof of the house and sat on the gutter with him when i was about 5, so of course mum took a picture of my dad and i sitting on the gutter with our legs dangling over the edge. After it would stop raining we would go outside and get a pile of muddie gravel and dirt mix together and throw it at eachother mum would then come out and say """" go on you 3 to laundry now"""" she would put us in these 3 trash cans each on of them full of water to clean us off. I have just notice that the words in this thread haven't come out as the way i had hoped oh well. Everyone has the strength to get throught their own personal battles nomatter how hard the battles seem, we will all get them sorted in the end. We all come from different backgrounds, different life experiences growing up and yet we all have a common interest that is to believe, support, have faith in eachother, inspire and encourage everyone on this forum to overcome each of our own battles that we are currently facing. I believe and have faith in all of you, you just have to find that inner strength inside you then you start to overcome your own personal issues. We all converge UID3760 on BB, we have all come in from our own paths which have led us to Beyond Blue to express how we are feeling, our past expriences and to UID1059. As i read over this thread i feel good but at the same time i feel down, i feel lonely, empty like something is missing inside. I don't know what is missing maybe because i'm not in a relationship. I don't know. I feel like this most days these days. It's weird to have 2 completely different feelings at the same time. If anyone replies can you send a hug please.

"Going out with the tide,UID905,""I'm not sure what the point of this post is or if it will even mak sesne. There is jumble of emotions in me..I'm not sure where to start. We went to the beach UID1861. It was too rough to swim but I stood in the shoreline, feeling the waves crash into my legs and leaning down, feeling the drag as the water was pulled back out again. All the water, pulled by a UID3004 nameless force that we humans are forced to bow befoe it. The day had been ok. I even let loose a few unconscious squeals of happiness as the water first brushed my legs, cold at first and then later the only place that felt warm. My husband lay behind me up the beach, hidden under a towel (he's red headed- him going to the beach for even ten minutes is like begging for a sunburn). Yet, sitting in the waves, feeling them go in and pull out, all I could think of was how easy it would be to just let go. Stop digging my self in the sand and let the tide take me. Where when I would go I don't care. Just away from UID3760. Away from me. I don't like me at the moment. I donlt like this house. I don't like the tree outside my window.

"How low will I fall?,UID3332,""Today is a disaster. I had an appointment to see a specialist that I've waited ages to see and it's for a serious health issue. I woke up dreading it but knowing I would force myself to go. I came downstairs and the first thing my husband said to me was """"your going to have a shower and get changed aren't you?"""". That was all it took. I saw him and my son off then rested against the back of the door and cried. I cancelled the appointment and now the specialist is on holiday and I do t have an appointment until January 14. I'm trapped, feel myself slipping away. If only I had either a good GP or Pschiatrist or Pyschologist. I feel so pathetic not being able to manage. The bills are still piling up, the lists are growing longer. I hate myself.

"Useless, hopeless feeling,UID3556,""A short while ago, my partner and my wonderful daughter headed down to the local club to have dinner together. That's something that we all usually do, every so often and it's just brilliant sitting there, having a chat about whatever"; just comfortable and relaxing. But now, I cannot go. I'm a pokie addict and in early December, I self-excluded myself from all clubs within our UID2106ty ... for a period of 6 months. And so UID3760 I am, home ... while UID1518're down there;" without me. DAMNIT all ... even the tears now won't come and I'm as emotional as all hell about this, I STILL I can't bloody well cry!!!!!!! Angry, pissed off, so upset ... all because I've got this stupid addiction. That was the way I felt on the evening that I created my self-ban ... and on that night, I did break down in the club ... UID1518 took me into a private room and I bawled my eyes out. That was the first time for ages that I cried, and the 2nd time for crying, was just the other day in front of a DVD. I cried at the club, cause I saw a young girl come into the club with her family and it rocked me. Just a hopeless, useless pokie addict and I really feel self harming ... I was gonna write something else then, but I've had things blocked before and I don't want this post blocked. Just a useless piece of trash, who's mind is stronger than anything and dominates me ...

"Hello darkness my old friend.,UID905,""Today should have been good. More good things happened than bad things. I got shopping done solo, made dinner and even hung out the washing. I also had a panic attack at the shops, bought things I shouldn't have and can't bring myself to do the dishes which are piling up while my husband lies sick in bed. I should be damn near happy right now. Instead I am sitting UID3760, wanting to cry my eyes out. Today started lower than UID1861 and is rapidly going down hill. I can't even force myself to smile. Alternately all I can feel is an overwhelming despair or a great numbness, like a bubble around me that prevents me from feeling anything. THere should be something in between shouldn't there? I am broken. I don't have the inbetween ground. One minute I am ecstatic and hopeful, the next i'm sobbing in the bathroom (not exaggerating, this litterally happened to me in the span of three minutes). UID3474 what to tell people when UID1518 ask how i'm going because it could change any few minutes. I just feel so out of control. I don't know what is going on inside my own head. I can't even control that. I want desperately to get some measure of control back. Something, anywhere. The only way I know to get control is self harm or a much more permanent solution.

"Help please - advice needed,UID3556,""Hi all I think I’ve written a few times now that I have tears in me, gallons of them, but UID1518 won’t come. I’m sad all the time, or next to all the time, but I cannot cry. Well, a short while ago, I had a meltdown and wow, the tears flowed. I received for Christmas a DVD pack of the latest series of one of my all time favourite shows (I won’t name it, as I don’t want to create any spoiler alerts UID3760). So I watched episode after episode and finally got to the last one today. And it was brewing in the way the show was panning out that it was likely to be sad (and worth noting UID3760 that I am emotional with movies and the like and will cry easily) and so the tears started to fall before the show finished. I got my partner to be near me"; but when the show concluded and it went to the black screen and the credits started, I yelled out “NO” and then burst into hysterical tears;" I was sitting on the edge of our lounge and I honestly think I passed out for a short while, ending up on the floor and sobbing uncontrollably. My partner was talking to me, but for a while, I didn’t hear UID3760. I was an absolute mess for around 10 minutes. Our dog was so concerned, and he was actually getting a bit stroppy with my partner, as he thought it was her, who did this to his master. I’m better now, but still hellishly fragile. I mean, it was only a TV show/series … what would have caused this? Does anyone have any thoughts? There was nothing in the series or the episodes that reminded me of my past. To actually black out for a short while was a bit unusual. But yeah, I'm feeling fragile and somewhat dumbfounded as well - and everything definitely doesn't feel right. I know I prescribe this a bit to others, but , it might be time to get yourself off to see my good doctor. "",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"I was born a monster..,UID372,""My Grandmother attempted to kill herself because she couldn't have any more babies after her previous 5 children. Her husband came just in time to call the Ambulance and save her life. After this my grandmother's husband decided to do the deed with his own daughter - in which she agreed to go ahead with. That daughter is my mother, and my UID2509's husband is my father. My birth is from the result of inbreeding and will forever be a burden on me. Yet I had no control over it, no opinion in the matter. Sure my father did it on somewhat """"good"""" intentions. But once he proceeded with this, it's was no longer his problem. It was mine, a problem that will never go away. A problem that was always destined to make my life pure misery. That why I can never forgive him for what he has done, what SHE has done. My family is no longer a part of my life- and I like it that way. I cannot do anything about what has happened, but I can at least do anything possible to erase it from my memory.. The worst part of this burden is that I cannot tell this to ANYONE I care about. Picture this: You have a wife and kids. Your wife asks you, why you keep your parent's history a secret and why you keep refusing to tell her the truth. You told her """"I don't want to talk about it"""", how does that portray yourself as a husband? You are suppose to be honest with the person you care the most about in life. But what if being honest, will be the reason for your relationship to fail. But at the same time, if you're not honest. Who's to say that NOT being honest won't also cause the relationship to end because of """"trust"""" issues. How do you persist to live, knowing that everyone you love will eventually leave once UID1518 find out a secret that you have had no control over. I'm weak and distress, the thought of killing myself now is a common thought. But, there is still a part of me that wants to persist. To take control of the opportunities I DO have a say over. To overcome this burden, and focus on the future. Not the present. To live a life with no regrets, no concerns and no more pain. But the path to happiness is a long travel - and giving up seems so much easier. I like to think of this being my first UID372EAL step in making my goal reality. Addressing my problem, and getting other opinions on the matter. Getting another view on the concept will hopefully UID1059 me see this as something I can eventually overcome... This is a very sensitive topic for me as you all can probably imagine. But I know, if I don't express myself on this then I will not be around much longer. Please don't judge me on what I am, judge me on who I am. Thank you all for reading my story... Peace."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Failing and Falling,UID3332,""Hi all Things are pretty hard at the moment. I've been trying so hard to achieve at least one thing each day that needs doing. But I'm feeling very low about myself. I think I'm really stressed with Xmas so close. I've only been the shops once and was so overwhelmed by the busy pushy people in crowded shopping malls. But I've got so much more shopping to do with the kids etc and I'm stressed its getting so close and I have so much to do. I still haven't tackled the pile of mail and am now getting messages on my phone from lawyers chasing outstanding bills. I wish I could just phone them and get it over with but what do I say about why I haven't called or paid earlier? Also I've always made a big effort at Xmas for the kids cause my childhood was so awful but this year I'm so stressed I'm not going to make Xmas as good as I want to for the kids. My husband just wants things """"fixed"""" and is very frustrated with me as he doesn't see why things that I need to do are so difficult. Also I'm dealing with things from the past. My sister who is a year younger than me has told my mum she was abused as a child by my dad and my mum believes her. Yet she never believed me. We are not a close family at all. When I was ten yrs old I went to my favourite English teacher and told her about my dad abusing me. I kind of had to as she had read my essays and asked to see me and said she could tell I was the girl being abused in my stories. I begged her not to tell anyone. The next day my sister and I UID372e called to the Principals Office. We are shocked to see my mum and dad sitting there. The Principal said """"Mares you have made some serious allegations and stories about your dad"""" and then she asked my sister is she agreed with me or if she was being abused in anyway. My sister just sat there unable to speak. The Principal then said """"you are both very lucky to have such cari g and forgiving parents. Mares your dad has e planned that you make up stories for attention especially when you want to get out of chores or have late homework. I think you should go home and think about your actions and how lucky you are to have a forgiving father"""". I will never forget the smile on my dads face. He was an alcoholic yet could be incredibly charming when he wanted too. We were very poor. Oh and of course it was a catholic school. Shortly after this my mother took us both to a dodgy Dr to put us on antidepressants because we were both bedwetters and her reasoning was that the antidepressants """"would sedate us at night so we wouldn't be afraid of the dark and cry for the light to be left on"""". Ill stop there-I could write a book of the dark childhood and trauma but its over-what I need now is to learn to live with my anxiety and depression and high expectations of myself which then turn into thoughts that I'm a complete and hopeless failure of a person. Just feeling dark and down today. Overwhelmed by all the things I need to do yet immobilised by them as well. I sit UID3760 going over and over what I need to do and by the end of the day I've achieved nothing. And with only few days to Xmas I'm so anxious and worried-I just want the strength and motivation to take a tion and Do things instead go thinking about them. I know so many people are finding this a difficult time so it's not just me and there's people in worse situations. I need and try to practice humility. Thanks for taking the time to read.

No sign of anything getting better;"  perhaps only worse!,UID3556,""Hi there Well, I’m in a constant state of nervousness, my depression is hellishly bad and has been for so long now. I’ve been diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder for around 11-12 years now"; but suspect that it goes a long way further back than that. It’s just that for the last 11-12 years I’ve been on medication and have been having ‘other treatment’ (like psychiatrist visits and psychologist visits). I feel like crying but the tears won’t come. I feel like I’ve got a large coiled spring in my chest/stomach, that continually turns harder and harder and I just wish it would release. I’m getting angry with myself, I do keep a daily diary (have done so for some 18 years) and I’m now finding that I’m writing in it that “I hate myself”. I have a partner and two fantastic children. I don’t think I’d be UID3760 anymore if I didn’t have my two children; UID1518’re both in their early teens. Things though have got to the point where I can’t share my downs with my partner anymore; I really don’t think she can handle hearing them anymore and to be honest, I feel somewhat abandoned, but then again, I can’t blame her, as it must be awfully hard on her as well. About the only thing I look forward to in my day is night time when I can sink a few beers and then go to sleep. Although a month or two ago, I couldn’t even look forward to that, for sleeptime at that stage just produced a lot of bad nightmares. At least UID1518 seem to have eased up somewhat. I’m on heavy medication as prescribed by my psyche and my most recent visit suggested that if I can change jobs (and not medication) that will UID1059. While I agree with this, in this current climate, changing jobs is so much easier to write than to achieve. I also keep fit; I go to my local gym almost every day of the week – however another dot point of depression for me is with me at the moment; I have an injury, which as stopped me going to the gym. The gym, which is usually my only outlet for stress release – but at present, I can’t even work out. I’m getting close to being able to return but for over two weeks now I’ve been crawling up the wall, due to know gym sessions. I am also into running and am doing that 2-3 times per week and being careful with that, to hopefully negate any chances of being injured. I also have a poker machine addiction and that is a source of stress and worry for my partner. She hates them, and for some unknown reason, I love them. And yes, while I have had some very nice and at times very big wins, for the other times, I have probably aided our local club with extra refurbishments that UID1518 otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford to get. That’s a fun way of saying that I’ve probably lost quite a bit of cash. But when you lose, the demons really come out to play with your mind and being UID1183 and losing money and I guess having the odd brew, probably isn’t the best combination. I have self excluded myself from a club that I frequented a lot in the past for one year, but I think that maybe this is something that is needing to happen again. So there it is: I have a home, a partner, two children, and animals (pets in our home), a car, a job, I’m on medication, I have regular GP appointments, as well as psyche UID3584tings, I exercise and keep fit; and yet I have major depression, fuelled with anxiety and ptsd. And as I get older, I feel the tension and stress is getting worse. I have made major inroads into writing a book about my story (detailing out what were the initial main causes for my depression) but also I’ve listed out what I call, my balloons of depression (things that are attached to me every day that cause me stress). When I list it all out, it’s quite a list and I’ve just realised that indeed, if the balloons were real and full of helium, I’d actually be floating away as there’s so many of the mongrels!! I don’t know what to do … I now have ‘no sick leave’ available and so I “have” to turn up to work every day or the money won’t come in … ahhh money, another balloon of stress! That’s a big balloon, that is! I tried 9 months off work earlier this year; part from stress leave and part for lwop;" and while away, I did feel better. Not near 100% as I don’t think I will ever get to that level again, but it certainly was better than what it is now (or what is was prior to going on stress leave). But I’m really stressed out at work. I’ve tried lots of options to get out but so far nothing has eventuated. It’s not so much the work, but the people that cause me a hell of a lot of stress. I’ve had a recent hospital visit due to chest pain … which fortunately ended in me being told that I’m fine and it was all put down to stress. Last week stress got to me so bad that I ended up self harming. <span style=""""line-height:1.6em"""">It really shits me, that I have done (or am doing) all the things that UID1518 say you should, in order to UID1059 with this illness and yet, nothing seems to work.

"This is my story and where I come from,UID529,""Hi Everyone, I have posted UID3760 a number of times but have never really introduced myself. I’m Suz and my story began when my mother committed suicide when I was five years old leaving me with a man who hated me, supposedly my father but maybe not. I remember back to one year old and know my mother knew that my father hated me. So how could she have left me in his care knowing how much he hated me? Having attempted suicide twice in my life";" the last should have worked (I thank God now that the medics were able to save me although I was very upset at the time that I woke up to find I was still UID3760)... so I know the mindset that comes with suicide. And that my mother would have thought her children would be better off without her as is apparent in her suicide note that I have from the inquest papers I have. My father took it out on me through physical and emotional abuse because he didn’t believe I was his child. The guilt was placed on me, whether intentional or not for my mother’s suicide and from that time onwards was a childhood of being beaten severely pretty much every day. The bruises heal, but the emotional taunting and put-downs stayed with me. That I was disgusting, just a ‘slut like my mother was’, I am worthless, lazy, a trouble-maker, and ‘No man will ever love you! They will just want to use you up because you are nothing!’ My parents came to Australia in the 50’s escaping communism in Former Yugoslavia. They lived as children through World War II through horrendous experiences that breaks my heart. Ultimately, we all just do the best we can with what we have. Our stepmother was deranged and dangerous and capable of the very worst. We, or at least I, often feared for my life. She was seriously mentally ill without ever being diagnosed and very cruel. There is much that I could say, but it would take too long. Basically, I left home at 15yo, was in some dangerous and potentially homeless situations for a number of years. Was an absolute mess and basket-case. I was pregnant to my partner of the time at 19yo. My beautiful daughter was born in 1981 and I promised her the world! All the things I longed for – the whole white picket fence scenario. But I couldn’t deliver. I was so unstable and I was a single mum from the time she was five weeks old (mutual) with no support from family or anyone. There are many good things in raising my daughter. She was my whole world and I had her back. But I was agoraphobic by this time and a mess with depression/anxiety. It was very hard for her but I always supported her and none of our family had anything much to do with us – thanks in particular to one manipulative sister. Her dad always had open visitation rights and was never pressured to pay more maintenance than he wanted to – I just wanted my daughter to know her father had her back. And, in his own way, he did have her back. I resorted to fundamental religions to try and find a sense of worth which only served to exacerbate my sense of worthlessness and that I deserved punishment – even burning in hell for all eternity. My daughter was raised in that crap and I don’t blame her for hating me. When she met her husband, he did everything to make sure we were estranged. Long story. Too long to go into. I resorted to alcohol from 2001 and was seriously suicidal for every day of at least five years (lastsuicide attempt was four years ago). The first thing I woke up planning every morning, the last thing I went to bed with. The fact my mother did it to us, was a preventative. I know what it is like to pay the price. But when I lost my daughter, there was no reason to keep fighting. How wrong I was!! UID372esorting to alcohol resulted in my daughter wanting nothing to do with me and not allowing me contact with my grandson. I don’t blame her. I understand fully and take responsibility. I moved state four years and a half years ago and am finding myself for the first time in my life – since learning to value my life through an epiphany after attempting suicide . For the first time in my life I feel like ‘I belong’. I have made some great friends. I still feel terribly lonely at times and worthless. But it is three steps forward two steps back. So bit by bit, there is every reason to hope! My Christmas will be with a friend and I look forward to that. I am doing lots of Christmas get-togethers with other friends before UID1518 go away. Mostly, Christmas and New Year will be spent house-sitting out-of-town for a friend going overseas – looking after their dogs and chooks and ducks and geese! Priceless!!! Well, that’s a little bit about me. Take care everyone – lots of best wishes – Suz xx"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Not Waving, Drowning,UID2254,""Hello. I've been struggling with depression for far too long, and tried to get professional UID1059 earlier this year. 6 months of counselling didn't UID1059, and my coping mechanisms of binge drinking, binge eating and lying to myself and others have stopped working. On top of this, I though being unfaithful to my wife of 13 years would UID1059, unfortunately, all that's done is end my marriage. I'm no good at maintaining any relationships, as such I have no friends (and as of 7 hours ago, no wife) to talk to. It's too difficult to talk to work colleagues about my mental health due to the stigma this attaches to you. To try something different, I've booked an appointment with my GP tomorrow and will ask advice regarding psychiatric treatment. Previous therapy has also indicated presence of alexithymia so I don't know if this has complicated any other therapies in the past. All this has come to a climax today, and I don't feel anything. No anger, no anxiety, no remorse, no shame, nothing. Just a void of emotion in a listless existence. The only good part of the story is that the void has created a calm spot to tread water for a moment - unfortunately, I'm to far out to sea to make it back to shore. Most definitely drowning, not waving."",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Helping someone through,UID1236,""Hi, I'm new to this but need some UID1059. I'm trying to UID1059 a friend through a really tough time. It's tricky because we used to be in a long term relationship. We have a wonderful, close friendship and there's no bad blood stemming from our having broken up, but needless to say it hasn't been easy. I've come through depression myself and have managed to get on top of a lot of it through counselling and lifestyle changes and meditation. My friend is trying a lot of the methods I've used and has made progress, however a new relationship in his life has been really traumatic and difficult for him. He's naturally a very sensitive, honest and caring person and I fee like this is being taken advantage of. I don't know how to UID1059 him realise he's worth more than he thinks and get him to realise this girl is going to continue to hurt him rather than UID1059 him. I want to UID1059 him move towards things that will make him happy. But now he's saying he wants to go overseas for an extended period of time, which can be an amazing life affirming experience, but I feel like he's not seeing it like this but as a means of escape, like he's running away. I'm worried that he'll become more isolated and withdraw more when he's away from the people that care about him. He has such little confidence and it's become worse since he's been with her. How can I UID1059 him realise he can't run away while remaining supportive of his choices and aspirations?

"Falling apart-losing control over my thoughts,UID3332,""Hi there again i saw my psychiatrist UID1861 and explained to her I was feeling very low-things I would usually do on autopilot such as get the kids ready for school and make their lunches-I was now at the point where I couldn't of had the energy to argue with them if UID1518 didn't want to go. That is SO not me. Having something ready for dinner each night-I completely forget. The lists of things I have to do are growing each day. I mentioned ACT therapy to my psych and her reply was that I knew the theories-what I needed was some practical UID1059 with things I have to do. She was concerned enough to ask if I would consider going to hospital for a break-but I couldn't do that to my kids right on Xmas. I don't have any """"support"""" people. My husband just gets frustrated. I am finding it hard to wan to get out of bed each day. And my psychiatrist says this is because I have no enjoyment in my life, only things I """"need"""" to do. She says given the amount of trauma I have experienced in my life there are bound to be effects to my self esteem, confidence as well as a fear of the unknown. So now I'm confused-am I so traumatised that therapy wouldn't UID1059 and just stick to seeing the psych every 3 months or do I drag up my whole past and go over it again using a different approach? I did email a Professor I found who specialises in ACT and she couldn't see me but gave me another name. She did state however that treatment would be very difficult and traumatic at times. I really don't want to relive my experiences-especially the ones involving child sexual abuse by my father and a priest and a """"stranger"""" rape several years ago. I wish I could feel """"normal"""" whatever that is just for a short period so I know it's possible to feel it again. Being defined """"treatment resistant"""" and on a high dose SNRI coupled with 2 augmentation medications-an antipsychotic and a stimulant-AND feeling this bad is quite frightening. My self esteem is at an all-time low. I wonder who I am and where the """"real"""" me has gone. I don't think I can go on like this much longer. I've always been able to stop myself from self harm by telling myself how important I am to the kids. UID2181 I just feel like a complete failure at everything and don't know what to do-the kids might be less affected by me if I wasn't around. Sorry-a really dark desperate day.

"To All the People Who Have Posted,UID529,""Hi everyone, I would just like to say that, to me, the common theme through this site is the sense of worthlessness and having no value that screams the loudest in people's experiences. A few weeks ago I felt the same way. I don't anymore. It is getting much better for me although I know I will have 'episodes' again. But UID1518 are getting less and less. Kind of 'three steps forward - two steps back'. You UID4232 are so worthy and so valuable and so very important! I wish there was a way I could communicate that to you that you could believe it and take it on board! I know that everyone has their experience and it is a journey for all of us. For me, understanding that 'others', be it family, friends, doctors, psychologists, the person in the shopping centre, can't possibly 'get' depression and anxiety. Not clinical or the real deal chronic depression. I also began to realise that when I am feeling fine and confident, I really don't care what other people think of me. When depression hits, I am devastated by even a 'look from a stranger' be it real or imagined. I'm beginning to get that it is not so much what other people think about me as what I THINK OF ME! It's ME that has to be HAPPY WITH ME, first and foremost. I'm also learning to live in the NOW. Not the past, not the future (except in practical terms). Living in the 'now' I guess is mindfulness. I remember up to five years old how happy I was. I was always in the NOW as children are when life is well. They don't hold onto the past";" UID1518 don't fear the future, UID1518 live in the moment. There is a lesson in that for all of us, whether we have depression or not. One day at a time, one moment at a time, one pause at a time. Pause, just for a few seconds and notice a beautiful blue sky, a bird, a tree - a computer or latest tablet, I Phone, if that is what is special to you. Just pause and find the moment of gratitude that you identify with.

"Can't ""act"" normal anymore -breakdown,UID3332,""Hi again Thankyou to all of the kind caring people who respond to me. UID1434 your response about not thinking ahead and just trying to get through the day calmed me down. Today I woke up and my husband had told me that all the research I was doing was not what he wanted and he only wanted one page summaries. I felt upset, I felt stupid and then I felt that he hadn't e planned this clearly when we initially spoke about it. So he goes off to work thinking ill probably get it done """"the right"""" way today. Then my children get up for school and I have no energy or ability to make lunches etc so was going to let them stay home. Usually UID1518 would love that-but today UID1518 got themselves ready and left, angry that I'd given them money for lunch instead of me personally making it. Petty things in the scheme of life. But I sat down and felt completely overwhelmed and unable to function or do anything. There is still so much mail &amp"; washing etc &amp; all the things I'd usually do -today I just closed the blinds and cried and felt like I can't live with this struggle anymore. My husband says it stresses him out &amp;" he worries his leukaemia will come back, he just finds it frustrating. I sent him a msg saying """"I need to tell you that I'm not well, I feel close to breakdown, I can't function and I'd probably go to hospital if I could"""". Haven't heard from him. I'm disillusioned that I'm defined as """"treatment resistant"""" and been on so many medications. I was upset when I applied for a online self UID1059 short course by Mindspot and a psychologist phoned me and said my scores were too high and I needed to see somone rather than do a course (despite the fact I do see a psychiatrist). And UID1861 I had applied for a research program at CRUFAD where half of the participants were to read a self-UID1059 book and the other half were to do a self-UID1059 online course. The aim was to determine whether a book or a course was more effective. UID2181here on the application did it mention medication. So a researcher phones me and says my application is suitable and we just need to do a half hour chat on phone to discuss further details-so we do this-and then at the end when she's told me I'm successful-she says """"oh one final question, are you on any medications?"""" -so I tell her yes, an antidepressant and then before I get out the word """"an antipsychotic""""-she interrupts me, quite distressed and says """"oh I'm sorry I should of asked you that first-we can't proceed any further with your application""""!!. I said to her nowhere did it state that taking medication was an issue, there was no question as to whether I took medication and why wait to the end of the interview to ask me if its a crucial factor in determining who is eligible? I also said to her that reading a self-UID1059 book or doing a short online course should not be affected by ruling out people who take medication. The book or the course could be beneficial to many people with depression and many people are on medication so I couldn't see how taking medication related to or impacted upon a participants involvement. Anyway that felt like another rejection. In the last two weeks I've isolated myself in the house I have done a lot of research on self-UID1059 program's etc. trying to UID1059 myself. I read a lot about a type called ACT-it's an acceptance approach to mental illness, depression in particular and seems to involve accepting ones illness rather than struggling against it and then committing ti changing the things you can. It's based on """"Mindfulness"""" and seems to have strong elements of Buddhist theory informing it. I now need to try find a therapist in Sydney. This has been my biggest hurdle-finding a good mental health practitioner. I only have my pyschiatrist who does not provide therapy but simply asks each time I see UID3760 what's been happening in life in general and then discusses scripts and medication. I've been seeing her for 6 years-my fault really for not having the courage to try a different one. I only see her every few months and the state I'm in I really need intensive support so I guess I should do something useful today and at least look into therapists. I feel immobilised by depression"; I feel as though a monster has invaded my mind and taken over my thoughts and ability to function effectively. I feel so so low. I can't face the world, I feel I can't even leave the house or answer phone calls. I've worn the same clothes all week and can't believe how difficult I'm finding it to do anything. I'm also frightened by my thoughts and the feeling that I've lost control over them. I'm extremely anxious around my husband and kids as I know my husband is so frustrated and feels pressured to manage his job and then come home to find I've forgotten to organise anything for dinner;" there are 3 baskets of washing that have stayed downstairs all week when I should of folded the clothes and put them away. He can also see the mounting pile of papers and mail and has said he has had enough of things being difficult and wants an easier life. I feel so so guilty about this as he has survived leukaemia and should be having a good life-not affected by my depression and my inability at times to do all the housework and cooking etc. I feel I am a hopeless case, I am consumed by guilt and fear. I hate myself so much. I used to be the strongest person. I've endured so much trauma in my life. And now I am a barely functioning person who is full of regret, despair, self hate as well as guilt and terror at the thought of how I will manage each day. I can't let my family down, I hate my current weakness, I dread what UID1518 must think of me. I just want to be able to do simple things like make the house nice, cook meals, organise events, get dressed each day, feel I'm managing responsibilities and making my family happy. But if today is any indication I'm failing at everything. I have the care and will to achieve things but I don't have the ability to do them as I'm immobilised, tears, scared and unable to almost move. It's like I really have been overtaken by a dark spirit who has taken all my strength and left me sitting immobilised in a chair where I can't move or do anything but cry and feel such deep shame and hopelessness. Where have I gone? Will I come back? I can't stand to live like this, it makes me feel as though ill become a burden and my family would be best without me. Just a very dark day and I'm so ashamed my husband sees me like this. Please I beg that I will come back and feel able to live and contribute to my family's happiness and take control of things again. I hate what I am today. So sorry...was desperate for someone to listen and maybe say something that might UID1059. You are all my hope. M x"",depression";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Pls help-I have to ""act normal"" but I'm nowhere near it,UID3332,""My family has no understanding of mental illness apart from my husband telling me its all ok & why am I worried-to my mother saying get it together, the past is gone and you need to be grateful for what you've got. I am grateful. The difficulty is having an illness surrounded by so much stigma and lack of support. The darkness is so consuming. I often think if I had a serious physical illness or impairment that people would go out of their way to UID1059. But having depression-i feel treated as though I created the illness and its not even defined as an """"illness"""" by so many people. My family see it as a weakness and my mothers only input is that perhaps I inherited my fathers genes. This is insulting as my father was a very abusive alcoholic who denied he had a problem and the guilt of the abuse I experienced as well S the lack of will to live eventuates in him chocking on his own vomit whilst intoxicated. I don't drink and I have a open, giving, caring personality compared to my father who was selfish in every way. I'm rambling. I guess I just needed to know someone cared about how I felt as I feel so emotional and overwhelmed. My husband has left me a UID3004 pile of research he needs analysed and typed up today and I'm so so tired and don't know how to get through it. My mother wants to UID3584t for coffee tomorrow as I've let her down twice and she says I need to get out of house as I basically haven't left it for over 2 weeks. She makes me anxious as she will UID3584t me. Say hi then say her usual """"come on we are going to have a good day, don't think or talk about how your feeling) and then we just walk around a shopping centre for few hours. It's getting so so hard to go out. I'm so low I just want to be locked away in the house. I'm afraid of everything and everyone. I don't know what to do. I know things I need to do are piling up and my tendency seems to hide in a book on an average day or sit in despair waiting for time to pass on others. I never ever believed this could happen to me. I had experienced so much trauma (as you can read in my earlier posts) yet for so long I was such a high achiever. I had senior management positions from the age of 25 and I commuted to work an hour each way to the centre of Sydney with my young children on the train who attended child care near my work. Then UID3800 I realised I'd been crying all week and felt similar feelings to those I experienced after the birth of my daughter. I just quit work and have spend last 6 yrs battling my depression and anxiety as though it were a full time job. I'd really like to UID1059 other people so I'm hoping to find some volunteer work in mental health or cris areas. But unfortunately Beyond Blue doesn't need any volunteers, Lifeline requires potential volunteers to undertake an intensive program which is quite expensive and also involves intensive training and monitoring on top of the course. I was also considering retraining as a paramedic, emergency call operator, parole officer or something where I'd feel that I was making a positive contribution to society. There's also MissionBeat & places like the Wayside Chapel that I guess I could contact. I know rationally that my two biggest problems at the moment are 1) my fear, lack of motivation and vulnerability about leaving the house and 2) the follow on effect of isolation, loneliness & self hatred thoughts that result from being stuck with my own thoughts & lack of interaction with others. My biggest challenge right now is getting the courage & self esteem to leave the house (despite fears that others can see my vulnerability and judge me). Closely linked to this is that by leaving the house I also challenge my self hatred and isolation and may find that going out can be enjoyable which would challenge my sense of isolation and loneliness.

"Can't function, feel such a loser, consumed bu self hate ,UID3332,""Hi all you may remember me from my earlier post about being on so many medications with little support. And my condensed story of growing up abused by an alcoholic father, turning to a priest for UID1059-who then sedated and assaulted me, a stranger rape several years ago, suicide of my father and the recent trauma of my husband getting acute leukaemia. Until the birth of my first child and again following the rape-I was such a high achiever. I didn't allow myself time to think about my life-I kept very busy & highly functioning. UID794 but me could tell the darkness brewing underneath. I gave up work several years ago because I wasn't coping with the pressure anymore & I wanted to be there for my kids. But the depression and extreme anxiety is ruining my life. I even applied to do an online self UID1059 course and a psychologist phoned me and said he was very concerned by my assessment results and felt I should see somebody ASAP rather than do a self UID1059 course. I've being seeing the same psych for 7 years-I think she just considers me too traumatised and says things like """"you are doing amazing under the UID2106rcumstances"""" and just hands out another script. But I'm not doing anywhere near """"amazing"""". I'm struggling to face the day each morning, I stress over stupid things like finding something to wear, I procrastinate all day even though I've written lists of things to do each day. The mail is piling up, bills unpaid, things I need to do left for another """"better day"""" that never comes. I feel completely hollow inside. Empty. Alone and wishing I could sleep and never wake up. Then I think how selfish of me would it be to leave my kids behind-UID1518 are all that's stopping me I'm sure. I also used to be a social. Bubbly person and I'm still a very warm and caring person that most people would find me easygoing BUT the change is I've isolated myself from everybody and even my own family (mother &sisters) who I looked after and was their mother figure-even UID1518 have no desire to understand me. My mother said from a very young age that """"feelings don't matter"""" and to get on """"with the cards you've been dealt"""". I am extremely lonely of a day, I usually spend most days (after ive organised kids for school) inside the house reading a book or looking up websites on depression etc. I wish there was a support service where someone would visit occasionally. Gosh I'm only turned 40 and I sound like an old woman! But having a visitor would UID1059 or knowing people in same situation to talk to. I'm really hating myself today, why can't I do something, why can't I get dressed, why am I locked in house with all blinds shut and its a beautiful day outside. I'm sick of feeling UID1059less and unable to deal with these feelings when I've dealt with many traumatic events before. And it's so so easy for me to feel a failure and blame anything on myself. I'm really stuck. I feel I need UID1059 desperately but I'm at home in Sydney with the kids by myself for a while and have no one to support me-but my daughter is 14 so she could UID1059 with my 9yr old son if I could get some UID1059. I literally feel like I'm being sucked down a drain and the water levels are rising dangerously. I really don't know anymore-this depression and anxiety has taken my life from me, I'm now just existing. Can't remember how happiness feels.

He's the only person I wanted to talk to at the time. But he was always to busy, and I realize now its not because he doesn't care or doesn't want to, its just that hes had a lot on too. But me being me couldnt be normal and control my emotions and instead have splurted everything out, ruined a surprise I had for him by telling him out of anger. Made him not want to speak to me at all, and left me feeling soooooo angry and sad. BUT........ I feel like he should try to understand more, he works away also and get very UID1183 when hes gone and I always make sure I am there for him, even when hes losing it. And I feel like he provokes me to push and push me coz he knows I will hate my self for days and be miserable while hes out and he knows I will then worry and make my self sick over it.

Today I did something I have not done in a while and that is send my resume and CV in answer to a UID1059 wanted ad.

Was just sending out a letter basically! Even thinking about it now has me shivering a little and I am not sure why, if its dread, fear, or me just being a twit, now do keep in mind that I have not worked in 13 years thanks to being run over. I have two advance degrees, a UID887 in computer networking and a Masters of Information Systems and I am even going after an MBA with a consceintration in marketing, so I do know my stuff for when I am applying for a job.

I am on a strong brand new SNRI which is also used as a pain killer.I expereince sideeffects and UID1518 are unpleasant. But UID1518 finaly took away my suicidal thoughts, the constant worry, my constant stressing about things. I feel on them like i am in a warm fuzzy relaxing oasis. I am so glad that i finaly gave in to accept UID1059. I dont know about you all, how you go with your meds, if UID1518 UID1059 you or not and give u side effects.

I can see now 3D wheras i feel before I looked at everyhting in 2D.Its like someone took away a glaswall around me and allowed me to live. Even if this drug is toxic to your liver makes you dizzy and nauseated, i rather put up with that than havinmg to live in a fishbowel being disconected and isolated from everything.I feel the disease had taken away the real me, and killed of the kind sensible caring person i once was.Today I realised what a stress head i must have been. I stressed about everything. I worried that it may rain if the washing is on the line,i worried about using too many gigabites and blow out my telstra bill, i worried about not getting a job , not being able to sleep if i have a coffee at 16.00 or that i fail an assignemnt which I havent even written.I also made an elepahnt out of nothing. I could fly off the handle for little stupid things. I broke out in tears if the coffee tin was empty and became suicidal if i got a big bill. At the end I was really bad and was speeding.bad speeding. I feel I would have killed myself or others within the next 4 weeks if I would't have gotten those drugs.Before I agreed to them i went to councelling, i walked every day, ate healthy and tried to talk things through with friends. But all those measures seemed not to do anything. I wonder now if I am one of those people were therapy just doesnt work because the basics, the chemicals were never right in my brain.

"Hi, need some advice regarding Depression and Aspergers,UID1664,""Hi, I have been suffering with depression for over 5 years now and have recently been diagnosed with Asperger's. I am Married and have 3 kids who I love and UID1518 love me. Depression for me was pretty bad (like most of us) and took me a while to see a doctor about having depression (I am a male!). The doctor put me on an antidepressant UID3237 (one per day) and I recently started to come off them. I am currently on 5mg every other day. The problem that I found is that the medication made me like a dump robot, simply walking around, not really thinking a lot. Before the medication I did think of taking my own life but I am at least thankful that I no longer have these thoughts. This drove my wife crazy because she could not get a conversation out of me. So we both decided that I should taper off the medication over 6 months and I am on my final leg. Because I think completely differently to most people and don't """"see"""" things as other people do also caused my wife a lot of stress, mainly because I put everything down to the medication. 6 months ago I was diagnosed with Aspergers. I know it's very late in my life (I am 40) but at least it provides some explains the way I think and act. I have also see a councillor (my wife also attended these sessions as well) to UID1059 be get to the root cause of my depression. At the end there was no one single answer that could explain this. I think this was due to a stressful job at the time. Coming off the medication has made me feel more me again, which is great but (there is always a but!) it has changed me. The new problem that I am currently facing is that my wife still says that I am snappy and moody with her all the time, even though I am finding this hard to see (not saying she is wrong, just cannot see it) which has been going on for several months now. For me, I just see me self, I not unhappy but I would say more confused than anything. When I talk to my wife I don't see my self being snappy or more, though I do see this now and then but not everyday. What this is doing to me is making it hard for me to talk to my wife, not because I don't want to but I have to think 3 or 4 times what I am going to say before I say it. I also try and think what pitch my voice should be so it does not come across snappy/moody. It seems no matter what I say or how I say it, my wife always takes this as me been snappy / moody with her, which is not. Any advice would be great. Thank you.

At first this didnt seem to bad but the novelty wore off quickly. The entire time was spent watching movies and playing video games by myself as I patiently waited for any of my so called friends to call/text and ask how I was or even hang out.. the entire time i didnt hear from anyone which really started to get me upset. I started smoking marijuana daily to pass the time and get my mind off why nobody cared, I then started feeling worthless and the horrible thoughts about death started. UID2327e passed I did my ankle rehab and started skateboarding and seeing my friends at the skatepark again.. UID1518 all asked what i did the whole 5 months and just seem to find my response amusing even though I think it is very sad.things felt like UID1518 were starting to turn around until April 24 2013 I broke my right ankle, since this has happened yet again im sitting UID3760 alone smoking marijuana alone all day and have barely left the house. I feel worthless everyday and ask myself why it happened to me and most days end up in tears thinking about it all. I know this all sounds pathetic but Skateboarding was my passion for over 10 years and ive known all my mates for around this length of time.. surely you would think somebody I have met in this time would have been there for me at least once. I have been unemployed since the first break and am unsure if I will be able to return to my usual work as a labourer once im healed again, this is another reason for me to feel hopeless. I have nobody to talk to, im not good at anything except skateboarding which at this moment in time im unable to do. and have no hope for gaining work in any other industry as i have no experience.

"Spiralling out of control,UID453,""Hi I’m Harry, 20. I’m not the one to try and reach out, talk to my friends or family cause I hate people I love, worry about me so I thought I’d try this I honestly can’t remember the last time I was truly happy. anyway long story short. I was sexually abused by a family “friend” multiple time around the age of 9-10. I grew up in a India till the age of 12 with my mum and sister, my dad was rarely in my life as he was working in aus trying to get us here. The person I looked up to, a father figure I guess, was my uncle, my best friend. Just before we were ready to move to aus he committed suicide. Ever since that day I’ve just been just numb. I started experiencing major depression and anxiety towards the end of high school. It has progressively gotten worse, I’ve tried committing suicide 3 times now. I’ve tried pretty much everything. SSRIs, Therapy, even talking to a close friend. Nothing works and it keeps getting worse. Now, Difficulty sleeping and when I do sleep I have horrible nightmares. They usually end with me dying. Recently i have been experiencing something wired it feels like I’m someone else, like my arms and hands don’t belong to me and I keep catching myself Making up these wild imaginary worlds with people I know in them and playing out scenarios in so much detail. Last weekend I broke down I’m front of my mates and started weeping. I only see one path forward and I don’t want to do that for the sake of my friends and family.

"Exposure Therapy How it works Advice or others experiences welcome,UID386,""I have started exposure therapy for PTSD. I originally started earlier this year but the lockdown made it impossible to continue. Yesterday the psych showed me pictures then photos, news reports & finally videos. I had to watch the video several times until it stopped causing high anxiety. I'm supposed to look up similar pictures on the computer at home between appointments. The aim is to become able to cope when I see or hear triggering images or information. Up til now I've been getting worse & then having to escape each time things trigger me which then leads to further avoidance & makes me worse.

"Coping with PTSD after open heart surgery at 23,UID327,""Almost 2 years ago I had open heart surgery to replace my aortic valve with a cows valve. I was 23 at the time. I was born with a bad valve and had surgery at 5 days old to repair it but I can’t remember that one obviously. I always knew I would need the valve replaced when I was older but it didn’t make it any easier. When I went in for surgery something went wrong and I nearly died, they tried to get my heart started again 2 times and then eventually got it going with a balloon pump. Later down the track I found out that they almost put me on an artificial heart machine which means a heart transplant. after the surgery I was put in an induced coma for 24 hours and then recovery began. I have never been in so much pain, my chest had been sawed open and my ribs broken. Everyone around me in the ICU was 70 or older and looked to be dying. I have always suffered with anxiety from a father with anger issues and being bullied at school and other heart problems but in ICU at one stage I felt so strongly that I couldn’t breathe that I almost considered trying to walk out of the hospital just to make them see how panicked I was. Come say 5 I started to get some relief but then for a month at home I slept sitting up and was in 10/10 pain all the time. eventually my body healed and I think everyone was really surprised at how quickly I was out and about. I then fell into really self destructive behaviour. My boyfriend at the time had cheated on me about a week before surgery so I didn’t really care about my actions at the time and would drink and party I guess without knowing suppressing my feelings. my sister is also an ice addict and went back to it while I was in hospital and then verbally abused me and left the week I got out and didn’t come back for 8 months (at the time I felt like she would never come back and would OD so was processing that too) about 4 months after the surgery I would have break downs and visions of being in ICU and also my sister leaving and would just cry alone and think how could anyone understand. Later down the track I discovered it was ptsd and went to see someone which really helped about 4 months ago I found out I will need open heart surgery again in June this year because the valve isn’t working right. I’m so scared I won’t be so lucky this time. It’s on my mind all the time especially before I sleep. Has anyone experienced this? Also does anyone have a way to try and drown out the thoughts before bed?"",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Mother with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Struggling. ,UID11,""Hi all, I could not sleep even though I'm utterly exhausted so thought to get my thoughts out here. I am 40 years old. Late in December last year I finally realised my mother had been abusing me for a long time. I decided to cut all contact virtually immediately. I do not regret that. Last night I came to the full realisation my mother has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Reading about daughters of mothers with NPD finally put some pieces of the puzzle together. I have a name now behind the reasons for my mother's abuse of 34 years towards me. I have read that many don't discover this till later in life. I KNOW now it was definitely abuse and an explanation for mother's cruelty to me. No wonder my therapist said it is like you have been brainwashed in some terrible cult. She did not know my mother has NPD either. I'm truly struggling with this. Many pennies dropping at once and my head can't stop spinning. I am feeling beyond angry. NPD is a horrible disorder. The thing is they are never responsible for anything. Anyhow this is very new territory for me sadly.

"The three Musketeers and the damage to me. ,UID11,""Hi Everyone, I call the the family I once had, the three Musketeers. It somewhat takes a little of the sting out for me. I was not able to use my voice for 40 years and I stayed quiet. I can't anymore. I was horrifically abused by all 3 Musketeers.The usual brood, 1 mother, 1 father and 1 younger sibling. I have no contact with all 3 Musketeers anymore. There is a lot to deal with. Older Musketeer Female has NPD. I only discovered this 2 days ago. I'm trying to make sense of one incident out of the thousands. When I was 14 or 15, the three Musketeers left me at home alone on Christmas Eve to go and celebrate it with another family that we did every year. I cried all night alone. I cannot understand this event and it is still hard to face it yet it haunts me so. I had a falling out with this families daughter. Their daughter had lied about something I did not do and it was a serious allegation. No one believed me at the time. I knew I was innocent of this accusation. Their daughter made life at high school for me hell and systematically manipulated school authorities to turn in me too. I went into a deep depression and no one cared to ask me if I was ever ok? No one at all. Not even the three Musketeers. Much later in life the older female musketeer said to me that the daughters mother said to her that night that I was still welcome there that evening. No further discussion was had on it. I made no comment. On the older female Musketeers 60th birthday she said she had a surprise for everyone. I was a bit excited. The surprise.... The daughters parents attending my mother's birthday. Did not know till they arrived. I said nothing. I stayed quiet. I have stayed quiet all my life. My issues is not with the daughters parents, it is with the older female musketeer and the other two Musketeers. I see now separating what happened as it is two different stories mixed in with one that I was a victim from the daughter from these parents. I see now the incredible damage it did to me and my life. I have decided to do my own victim impact statement and send it to the parents of this daughter. I'm doing it for me and that's right for me. I don't understand. This is me telling that story for the first time. ."",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Am I experiencing PTSD?,UID322,""Hello there, About 5 months ago I was woken up to what I thought was an aggressive break in next door right outside my bedroom window. There was lots of crying, screaming, banging on the garage door and glass smashing from the house next door. A person had died so the cries were gut wrenching screams (I wasn't aware of this until the next day). As I called the police I remember feeling so terrified as I listened to the events unfold and felt helpless. I remember begging the person on the phone to get the police out faster because the people next door sounded terrified. It was really traumatic for me as my biggest fear is to be broken into while I'm at home and I guess not being in control of the situation and not being certain that myself and the people around me are going to be okay. It makes me feel sick thinking about it. It didn't end up being randoms that broke in, so I should feel better knowing it wasn't a random attack but there is more to the story. I now have mini panic attacks before falling asleep at any sort of noise that I can hear outside, which happens most nights. My heart races and I struggle to breath. I constantly am checking my house cameras, especially late at night. I constantly check my community pages on social media and when I hear of a break in around my suburb I Google to see how far away it is. There are break ins quite frequently in the area that I'm in, which doesn't help my stress. However, I feel I would be like this where ever I live as I live out of home and now it's not my parents who would take the brunt of it, it would be myself and my partner if something happens...and this scares me. I don't know how to get over this and forget about it. I don't want to feel this way every night. I thought by now I would have forgotten about it but something about the screams and cries and initially thinking it was an aggressive break in has really triggered me. Five months later and I'm still like this....am I experiencing PTSD? If so, what do I do?"",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Work based ptsd,UID417,""Hello everyone, I received a diagnosis of PTSD in October 2018. The reason for my diagnosis is from a previous job where I was exposed to a lot of family dysfunction and child abuse/neglect. I have been seeking psychological assistance for 18 months, 13 of which have been emdr and it has been incredibly helpful. I no longer work with kids or families, however my current role requires me to read intimate details of childhood abuse. This used to lead to light headedness, accelerated heart rate and agitation, which has since subsided. I do notice though that for the remainder of the day and into the next day I feel emotionally fragile, have little tolerance and notice the hypervigiliance creeping in. I can continue on with my day, challenge my thoughts, engage in mindfulness or distraction ect but something within me just doesn't feel right if that makes sense. I am wondering if anyone has experienced a similar feeling ? I should also say that I have worked incredibly hard to be in the area of work that I am and in no way do i wish to give it up!

"Recently diagnosed with psychosis from PTSD,UID786,""Hi everyone! this is my first post on this forum, I have been in intensive therapy for a bit over a year, last year I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt as a result of my depression and anxiety, along with my developing psychotic symptoms. I am doing a lot better than I was last year, but recently I was officially diagnosed with psychosis, and it's taking a toll on me. I have used up my therapy sessions, but I don't think I want to return to it for a while because I think I can cope by myself now, but I'm just looking for a bit of support on these forums. I had an extremely bad acid trip on new years a couple years back, and I've never felt the same since. I have 1st episodic psychosis and PTSD as a result. It drives me nuts.. I'm often very paranoid, and I have slight auditory and visual hallucinations, though nothing too extreme, it makes me feel like I'm going crazy. I feel dissociated literally 100% of the time, and it makes my work life and social life quite difficult. For example, I get confused about my surroundings, it feels like I'm looking through a screen all the time, like nothing is real around me. It feels really scary but I'm just trying to accept that this is my life now. Sometimes I get so confused that I don't see where I'm going and I might walk into someone or something by accident. My vision is always fuzzy, and I can see halos around people. I know it sounds crazy, and I know it's just my illness but it gets so tiring having to act normal around people, like I'm not experiencing anything. I guess I'm really scared of this developing into something like schizophrenia. It would be reassuring to hear from people with psychosis or a similar experience to me. I feel there is so much stigma around it because people think you're crazy or will harm others because of it, which isn't true at all. I also have really bad depression and anxiety, and I have panic attacks a lot simply because I get anxious about the possibility of getting anxious. It's so draining UID50023 Anyway, sorry if I have rambled a lot but I'd just like to get some reassurance that I'm not alone and I'm not crazy."",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Experiencing immense grief, sadness, loss, loss of hope and angry over family. ,UID11,""Hi, I am an adult survivor of Childhood abuse and Trauma. I was abused by both parents growing up well into my adult years. I am now 40 years old. I let go of him (male family member opposite to a mother) I cannot even say the name. I let him go just after I turned 30 years old. I finally realised it was not my fault that my father did not love me. 18 years of my life completely wasted. It took me roughly ten years to deal with the grief, loss and abuse. It was so so so hard. I did not go to counselling. In hindsight maybe I should have but cannot be undone what is now done. I still have some things to work through in regards to him but nowhere near as much as my two remaining family members, her ( again opposite to a father) and my sister. I have made a choice that when he passes away (not that I will find out probably) that I will not be going to his funeral. He did not want me being alive, so really he does not deserve my farewell or respect. I already said goodbye to him. I know there is no chance left nor hope of ever having a relationship. So I have said my goodbyes in my own way. Sometimes it still hurts, like when I am going to do something that any daughter would love to have him with them and I feel sad for a moment. I guess no matter how much work I do there will always be a small part of me that feels a pang of sadness sometimes. I don't acknowledge Fathers day and I don't acknowledge his Birthday. I just get on with things. 5 months ago I left a same sex Domestic Violence relationship.Nobody knew I was in a Domestic Violence Relationship. I still have that to heal and recover from. When my remaining family members found out, I was not even going to tell them, My sister never did a single thing, not one single thing to help me or support me. My mother came to court with me once and I will not say what she did that day, I will just say that after many many many years of severe abuse and trauma from both of them, something inside of me said NO MORE. It was a real strong NO MORE and I meant it which changed my whole world. So to cut a very long story short, I am currently in a place now where the hope has died. I held hope for a long time. Hope for the family I needed and wanted. I have come to realise neither of them actually want to change and that is why my hope has gone. They don't want therapy and it is all about them.

"Heart shattered to bits. ,UID11,""I wrote a """"letter email"""" to my mother this morning. It was painful and I cried. I wrote to get to advise her that I had decided to cut contact for the time being. It is the second parent I have had to cut contact with. I did my father ten years ago. I didn't even tell him I just cut contact and have not looked back since. I didn't have any support and did not look for support. This however I know I need to instead of trying to do it alone. In my letter to my mother I named the abuse and some of the incidents of abuse she inflicted on me. The abuse went on for 33 or 34 years. One of those numbers. That is a very long time. I told her how the abuse made me feel and I told her how much damage it had done to me and my life. I told her that I have wounds and scars for life. I told her about the things I have never been able to do, still cannot do and may never be able to do because of the abuse. It is not possible for me to heal fully nor make a full recovery. I do wonder if anyone will love me even with my past. I know I will never find myself in another abusive relationship again, I just wonder if someone healthy, loving, kind and good will be able to love me or just see me as """"damaged goods"""". I told my mother that the abuse was not my fault and that there are no reasons or excuses that justify the abuse inflicted on me over the years. I told her about the flashbacks I live with.

I also said that I could not promise when and if I would ever be in contact again and I would not put that pressure on myself. I told her that I would not be responding to any emails. I had to work through so much fear before sending it. """"What if my mum did something stupid""""?. """"Is she strong enough to cope with this""""?, as she is getting older now.

"Left an abusive relationship! Finally! ,UID475,""Hey guys, I finally got the strength to leave a 9 year abusive relationship. I have never felt lighter! I am free! My relationship with my partner was physically and mentally abusive. He called me names, he pushed me, slapped me and even spat on me a couple of times. He put me in hospital twice. He always put me down, he manipulated me, he lied to me and cheated on me. Pretty much the relationship from hell and yet I loved him so much (crazy right?) He is a drug addict and that is what I always blamed for his abusive behavior. I knew what he was doing was wrong but I stayed because I loved him and told myself it was the drugs not him that hurt me. I have always considered myself a strong, independent person so I hid what my partner did from everyone because I was ashamed of myself for letting him treat me that way, I was embarrassed and angry that it had gone on so long. After I finally started reaching out to people (starting with my gp) I was so lucky because instead of being judged (which is what I feared) everyone was so understanding and supportive. No one put pressure on me to leave because it was ultimately my decision but they let me know that they were there for me. I wasn't alone. My partner decided to not come home or answer his phone one weekend and I decided enough was enough, he didn't even respect me enough to answer my phone call yet we'd been together so long?! I knew then and there that it was never going to get better so I packed my stuff and my pets, cried a lot and then moved out. I have not shed a single tear since. I wanted to share this because it was so so so so hard for me to leave, the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the best thing I've ever done for myself. I didn't even realise that the relationship was consuming me and not in a good way. I thought about the things my partner did to me 24/7 and now I never think about that because I know it's over and will never happen to me again. If anyone else feels trapped in an abusive relationship please know that it only takes 5 minutes of courage to take that first step and tell someone.

4 year old grandaughter recently traumatised by fire. Advice wanted to help her family support her.,UID386,My Son lives overseas with his family. A few days ago he found his daughter in the kitchen with a burning tea towel on the floor & his daughter screaming too petrified to move. He put the fire out & tried to comfort his daughter. She was so badly traumatised she can't talk about what happened so noone knows what caused the fire. She was convinced the house would burn down so couldn't sleep in her own bed but had to remain with her parents. Hearing this triggered very bad memories for me with a similar incident when a spark from an open fire place set fire to a favourite piece of clothing. I was about 4 at the time & had to throw the burning item into the fire to avoid setting the house on fire. I was left with an intense fear of fire which escalated when I was caught in a bushfire which destroyed our home. Remembering the fear of fire I had as a child from that first event makes me want to help my son help his daughter deal better than I did with the trauma to avoid the long term consequences.

We had to remain in the burning house until the burning bush outside died down so we could escape by foot. Reports of bushfires caused extreme anxiety from then on even if I wasn't directly impacted. In between I managed OK. Black Saturday & the following weeks we had bushfires near to our home. UID960 enough to get burning embers landing around our home. Since then I have been diagnosed with PTSD & things which prior to Black Saturday were not issues have become triggers.

"PTSD triggers and stigma,UID885,""Hi all There have been a couple of posts recently about negativity towards people who are triggered by events and go into a PTSD response which results in anxiety. I think there is a view out there by people who do not understand what Post Traumatic Stress that 'an industry is being promoted' by psychologists and others. How awful is that! The same can be said about a range of illness that have been diagnosed over the past 50 years or more. The scientific evidence and research that has happened in the past 50 years is so advanced that IMO people are afraid. IMO, it's much easier for people to live 'in ignorance' than to really look at what's happening in their environment. I truly believe PTSD falls in this category. It is so easy to say, it's 'all in your head'. Well, yeah, that maybe but that does not devalue what is happening for people. Nor does it mean that it's 'stupid', 'not real', 'not happening' etc. Yes, things do happen in your head, they can be good or not so good. That's why we have mental health plans. What I really want to debunk here is - that PTSD and it's triggers are STUPID. PTSD and triggers are real and have lasting effects both for the person who is experiencing them as do people who provide support to those people. You will find some talk about complex PTSD along with 'normal' PTSD. I'm not making any distinctions between the two, though from what I've read in the forums there is a difference. This thread is for people who get triggered and go into anxiety. Doesn't matter what the trigger is. Your triggers are real. They occur at times when you least expect them. No one else can say to you that you are stupid. Responses to triggers do happen. Triggers can: Would love to hear what others think. Please have your say. My words are only from my experience.

"Triggers ,UID885,""Hi all Started this thread to get a discussion going about triggers. Honestly, I have nothing planned as such for the thread. I am interested though in how people manage themselves once triggered. I was recently triggered by hearing an neighbour’s scream that sounded like she could have been sexually assaulted. Someone called the police and when I popped in to see her the next day. My hand of friendship was rejected. it’s taken me over 2 weeks to realise this was a trigger. I’d been putting it down to other things. But I couldn’t stop my -racing heart, grumpiness, withdrawal from everyone, leading to lack of energy and interest in doing things. The triggers were many * thought of someone being sexually assaulted * feeling of rejection * feeling of my inability to save someone in distress Now that I ‘be identified these. I can address each one in turn and hopefully move on and out of the depression I could feel starting to take hold. Has anyone out there a story to share about their triggers, how they identify them, or the difficulties in doing that. I finally identified this recent bout, by not sleeping. My palpitations were so bad, so I went over everything that’s happened in the last few weeks. There had been a couple of things I looked at but still couldn’t settle. Then I found it. Wow my heart lifted, stopped running. Can now think of positive thoughts, things to do. The relief of identifying cause is almost instantaneous. Now to put on that slow cook, make some gluten-free blueberry muffins. My reward! that’s it for now. UID885"",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I am an absolute wreck and, while I trust my psychologist I don't trust the reporting process, the police or the objectivity of the professional bodies who need to be advised and so my therapy (and recovery) is at a standstill. I wish there was a magic wand to erase my memories of the last 5 years because I just want to forget about the whole mess and get my life back. Of course, there's no quick fix and I know I need to talk about what's happened in order to process it and move on. The problem is though that I am too scared to speak about it because I know that once I do, we have to make the necessary reports. Has anyone found that reporting their abuser helped them recover? Has anyone fully recovered from sexual abuse without making a report? I just want to feel better but I am so scared that going through the reporting process is going to make things worse. Thank you so much for reading."",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Living with PTSD for 54 years,UID885,""Hi all, Just wanted to share my experience. I had always felt my childhood was unhappy, but I could not understand why. When I was 12 I developed asthma and throughout my 20s and 30s I'd have these moments of unexplained 'anger outbursts'. I developed strategies to manage this anger because I hated it. I also found I was never comfortable with women friends and it was difficult trusting anyone. I drank to excess, picked men up for one night stands. Then I met my husband of 35 years. It turned my life around, I could finally trust someone and share a fulfilling life. I just believed my behaviour was normal for the loose 'sexual years' of the 60s and 70s. Then 7 years ago while travelling through a town I remembered I'd been there on a holiday when I was about 11 or 12. My mother and father dropped me off with some cousins of mum's for a week or so. I never remembered anything until 7 years ago, when we stopped for coffee. I said to the person behind the counter oh, I know xxxxxxxx and xxxxxx. The response was 'they're dead'. That was it. As we travelled out of the town I started getting 'pornographic images' (something that was totally unusual for me). I talked it over with my husband - saying how strange it was. Well, that was roller coaster for me. I can't imagine how I could have kept the sexual abuse (rape) locked away in my memory for so long. My health suffered, I went into major depression and anxiety. I could not believe what was happening to me. My whole world turned upside down. For months I cried my heart out with a psychologist until I could no longer function and had to cease work. The GP put me on antidepressants and I saw my psych almost daily for about 2 weeks. I finally went back to work after about 3 months and more recently retired. Since retirement - my PTSD has been triggered. I've worked for 50 years and kept on the move one way or the other. I now have to face life full on. There are neighbours who have volatile arguments - this has been my latest trigger. My psychologist has retired and I don't like my new one. Ugh.... I want to sleep, but it doesn't come at the right time - night time. I can go to sleep about 5am and wake at 11am. But that's not what i want...Wow, have I had a whinge or what. There are many more people out there who had it a lot worse. My life has been good considering. I only wish I could have remembered the trauma earlier. Though as some say, I probably couldn't have handled it."",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Torn and broken,UID73,""Hi, I have PTSD and things are getting worse not better. brief description of why: Nov 2012: my wife confessed to a 6mth affair with a mate of mine.

"New psychologist......,UID885,""Hi all Everyone welcome to have their input. This week I'm off to see a new psychologist. My previous one retired and I've been trying to find a new one. The last two were pretty average and didn't help me at all in what I needed, i.e. to get through episodes of PTSD, anxiety and depression. So, how am I feeling? While I've been waiting for my appointment, I've become very active in writing in BB. This has helped me to realise how - NOT ALONE I am. While it's not good for those of you who are experiencing these episodes, I do take comfort that help is at hand. So, what am I afraid of? That I have to retell, relive, re-experience my trauma(s). Yuk, oh yuk. However!! When I started with my last (good) psychologist, she did not need me to retell, relive, re-experience my trauma. It was good enough for her that I had already opened up everything and explored all the hidden secrets with the previous psych! So it was easy for us to move on to 'identifying those things I was currently experience', 'what processes I needed to put in place to move on', 'get in touch with my inner child and give her the comfort she'd never had'. So, what does this Thursday have install for me..... Hopefully, if he's worth his weight in gold, i'll not need to open up the scabs that have closed and healed. That we'll move on to how to proceed being retired, no longer working, suffering bouts of PTSD, anxiety and depression. So keep your fingers crossed for me.... Will let you know how I go (BTW, my GP says he's very good :) ) Here's hoping!! Kind regards PR"",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"domestic violence against men,UID325,""I am currently studying community welfare and began the subject Domestic Family Violence. Although many men do experience abuse from their partners, this is not recognized in my course. When I asked the teacher about it, she reported to me that men being abused by women would and should be treated differently and receive less support. Its been a long hard battle for females to gain rights so we should be treated better than males? I don't think this is the """"equality"""" I visioned as a female.

"I’ve been lying to my family for 6 years. ,UID999,""When I was 8, a terrifying fear came alive. My parents were going through a divorce at the time and it would tear them apart to find out. This was the first step in my adventures that would cease to end. Once my parents spilt was final, another problem arose";" my mother would withhold custody from my father if she knew what his brother did to her daughter. She even liked to talk about how “if that man had ever touched you, tell me and I will make sure that I tell your father you’re not going there ever again” she didn’t mean it as a threat to me but I still remember the imminent danger it possessed. I was only 8. Years later and these were the things constantly weighing me down and always at the back of my mind. Then I was 14 and my father sat my sister and I down to talk about why we were so afraid of his brother and that our fear of him was merely a product of my mother’s manipulation. I then broke down and began telling the tale of when my uncle sexually harassed me. He stood up and walked out of the room, no words spoken. We went to my nonno’s funeral that day and later on at the wake, my father pulls me aside and tells me my uncle has a chemical imbalance in his brain, that makes him more sexual but he takes medication for it so it’s under control. This was honestly the excuse he had to say that I had to have been lying. Now, my 2 year old sister that I don’t live with is apparently my uncle’s “favourite niece” and I’m so scared because I know it will happen to her eventually but there’s nothing I can do about it without losing my dad. It breaks me down further and further in so many ways. I don’t know what do anymore."",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Nightmares,UID475,""Hi everyone and Happy 2018, I haven't posted here in a little while because things have been going so well, I feel very lucky at the moment. My psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD after a long term abusive relationship. I managed to escape that relationship a year ago and have been going very well since and have managed to get through most of the physical and psychological issues I had from it One thing I can't seem to shake are my post traumatic nightmares. I dream about my ex trying to kill me, about the police raiding my home, about being terrified and physically hurt. Pretty much any event that happened in the past where I felt extreme fear, stress or pain- I dream about it. They happen a couple of times a week and more often when I sleep alone, my partner is a fifo worker and when he is home I don't seem to get them or if I do I don't remember them (my partner sometimes wakes me because I'm moving a lot or crying out) When I sleep alone they are so vivid and realistic that I wake up terrified and in a sweat. Has anyone had experience with nightmares? Anything work to get rid of them or at least make them less frequent? Open to any suggestions : ) Thanks!

I returned to work the following week.I returned home from work that evening to find him sitting in our living room like nothing happened. I was really angry. He had put his motorcycle away in the garage to hide the fact he was home and was expecting me to be pleased with his little 'surprise' homecoming. I told him how much walking out on me again had hurt me and he basically told me it was all my fault and I deserved it, and that I had no right to be angry at him. I spoke to my mum via Skype when he left and she advised me to get out, he has over the years been mentally and emotionally abusive (never physically), my mum is a medical professional and thinks he possibly has Asperger's."",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"How Do You Trust Again When Your Soul Is Crushed?,UID922,""Today I find myself racked with fear & anxiety. Thoughts plague my heart, unrest eats at my soul as the question goes over & over in my mind.... What if there is no one out there who I can really trust? How do I know that people are who the say they are, who they portray themselves to be? How do you know, how can you be sure, when everyone, every authority, every supposedly """"safe place """" has betrayed or abused my trust- be it the Dr & radiologist who sexually abused me at age 5 or my parents who didn't make home a safe place, rather a war zone.

My friends who promised to keep in touch but I haven't heard from in 8 years, all the friends that abandoned me when I told them I had PTSD & depression. So many people I trusted that turned out not to be who I thought. So many peoples words, that didn't mean what they said. My whole life feels like one big lie! It's not a safe place when you have no one you can trust! I get not everyone will like me or want to be my friend. I'm not everyone's cup of tea. I'm totally ok with that! What hurts is when people pretend! All I want is for people to say what they mean &amp"; mean what they say! Don't pretend to be my friend if you don't really mean it! Don't say you will do things if you have no intentions of putting actions to your words. If you're going to hurt, hurt me with the truth-not with lies! I need to know there's someone who I can trust. Someone authentic, genuine, sincere. Someone who is who they appear to be. Someone who ONLY says what they mean &amp;" means what they say!

"Abusive Ex is now in jail, I feel weird about it,UID475,""Hi all! It's been a little while since I've started a new post because I've been extremely lucky in that everything has been going well. However I found out on Saturday night that my ex partner is now in jail and it kind of threw me for a loop. We were together 9 years and he always battled addiction and obeying the law. In the end his ice addiction changed him and he became physically and emotionally abusive towards me, even putting me in hospital twice and cheating on me. Leaving was hard because I loved the person he was before drugs but it was the best thing I ever did as the person he became was hurting me a lot. I don't love him any more and have had no contact since leaving (about 7 months ago), I have an amazing boyfriend now and have well and truly moved on from the past but I don't understand my feelings when finding out about his situation especially because everyone saw it coming, including me. I feel shocked, sad but also overwhelmed with relief that I don't have to be the one picking up the pieces for him while he was in jail. I feel devastated for the person I once knew, despite the fact that he hadn't been that person for at least 18 months due to his ice use. His sister has tried to contact me but I don't want to see his family because I want to leave him and any ties to him in the past but is that selfish of me? After I left, all I felt was anger and resentment for him and didn't care at all about what happened to him. But now that something has happened, I feel sad? And although I feel sad, I still have no desire at all to make contact with him or see him. I'm confused about my own emotions which is frustrating. I've been talking to family and friends about it but everyone seems to think I should be so happy with him being in jail after what he did to me and of course, his own actions put him there but I just don't feel happy about it.

PTSD from natural disaster as a child,UID386,I was 10 when I was caught in a bushfire which destroyed our home in 1965. I stood in the house waiting to die. We walked out through the UID836uldering bush after the fire front past. Afterwards I felt guilty for not doing anything to help eg gathering photos etc as they were all lost. In those days you were expected to get back to 'normal'life straight away. Life was never the same as we moved away to a new area were it was hard to make friends. I struggled on my own to overcome many challenges eg learning to use a match to light a stove or fire took several years and I felt very embarrassed about it. I compensated for my guilt feelings and poor self esteem by working hard to achieve goals such as high academic results and also by helping people (particularly my parents). My mother became disabled so I took over the shopping and other housework as a teenager. Later I cared for her full time for 12 years after my father died. More recent bushfires including Ash UID1043 and Black Saturday have been close to us (sparks & embers landing in our garden) thus stirring up bad memories. I react strongly to reports of fires even in other states. I have recently started exposure therapy to help me deal with my problem. Hot dry summers are bad for me and I recently injured myself & have had to give up work because my husband has been very ill and it became too difficult to work and care for him. This means my normal strategy of working hard to drown out the negative feelings isn't possible at the moment. I wondered if anyone else had experienced anything similar and how they dealt with it. In my case it wasn't just the traumatic event but all the losses ( including complete change of lifestyle) experienced afterwards which have had a negative impact on my mental health,ptsd-trauma;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

My heart breaks & goes out to all Vietnam Vets & their families! I am sorry you never got the hero welcome you deserved. I can not imagine how painful it would be to come home to your country who treated you appallingly! And who failed to see the sacrifices & suffering you went through for your country! Please forgive us for not showing the gratitude you all deserved & for our ignorance! I want to thank every Vietnam Vet for your service, sacrifice & suffering you continue to endure for your Country! I have nothing but ABSOLUTE honour, admiration & great respect for you! I wish I could personally meet every Vietnam Vet to give you all a big hug & say Thank you! YOU ARE HEROS IN MY EYES! So Dear Vietnam Vet I salute you!

Horrible dream triggering anxiety & bad feeling about myself,UID386,As background information I was diagnosed with PTSD related to being caught in a bushfire a child. Most of the time I am fine but find hot weather particularly if the fire danger is high I struggle. For the last week it has been hot and now my husband who I care for is sick. I am currently on some medication for a physical health issue which is making me feel blah! On top of that I am tired from lack of sleep due to heat &amp; some health issues. Last night was very hot (although fire danger wasn't severe) & my husband was coughing & sounding very ill. This led to a very broken sleep. At one point I had a horrible dream about a bushfire where I couldn't think straight enough to organise myself so I could leave before too late. I found when I woke up I was still half in the dream & spent the rest of the night worrying about how useless I was. When I got up I was still breathing fast & feeling very shakey due to the anxiety & bad feelings brought on by the dream. I know it was a dream but that didn't stop it triggering the negative beliefs about myself caused by the original fire. Thoughts include feeling guilty & useless because I didn't do anything to help as a child with the dream reinforcing the fact that I still can't deal with situations where I need to act as a competent adult to prevent harm to myself or others. This then morphs into feeling useless anyway. I feel like when it is hot my life is put on hold. I'm unable to do anything useful and I can't do anything enjoyable. Summer stretches in front like a prison sentence. Does anyone else relate to this.,ptsd-trauma;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Not sure if I have PTSD,UID559,""Hi, I've never been on a forum before... I was in hospital in isolation for around 15 days and due to an autoimmune response to pnemonia my face and body were disfigured. I couldn't recognize myself in the mirror, barely open my mouth because my lips were so swollen and I needed breathing assistance. After leaving the hospital and my face healing up I still Have trouble recognizing myself because I had lost so much weight during the process (which isn't a bad thing) but it freaks me out. Now that I'm home I can't sleep because everytime I close my eyes I see my face all disfigured, when i cough I start having a panic attack because I think I'm going to choke again and I'm extremely high strung. I already have a panic disorder which isn't helping the situation but i was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this? I'de like to stop re living the whole experience but it won't go away and it's basically all I think about all the time and it really scares me. Thanks in advance for any advice or similar stories."",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Feeling extremely anxious due to PTSD trigger need advice to calm down,UID386,I was doing OK for the last few days and on track with goals set by my therapist. I probably pushed myself too hard today so I am exhausted hence no resilience. There is a smell of UID836ke in the air and reports of bushfires. They are nowhere near me and I have checked the website to confirm I am not in physical danger. Unfortunately telling myself I am safe doesn't change the reaction I am having. I need to calm down and stop worrying but I can't.,ptsd-trauma;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Learning to deal with trauma by finding positives in learning or growing afterwards,UID386,I am using this thread for my own benefit but would be glad of others input. Last time I saw my psychiatrist & discussing the negative impacts of several traumatic & bad experiences he asked me to come up with positives or things I've learnt from the experience. Following his suggestion I started writing down things each day and this helped me but once I stopped things went downhill so I thought I would try again using this thread. Hopefully it may inspire others to find some positives to help them deal with their own trauma. My idea is not about making the event itself positive with comments like 'at least you survived' because that doesn't help. Positives I can think of today are: By being poor due to losing everything in the bushfire I have learnt to manage money well & can save & go without to get what I really need. This was a benefit when my husband was out of work and now that we are on carers & disability pension Because of my low self esteem I compensated by working hard at school so I got good marks. Thjis meant I was able to focus on my studies and got a scholarship to study at uni. I missed having relatives in Australia so I really appreciated my family and went out of my way to stay close to my brother which meant my kids are now really close to their cousins & my brother has helped me a lot when needed.

"Police threatening abuse victims with jail :/,UID95,""I am a 32 year old survivor of child sexual abuse. The events took place across a period of around 6 months in the 1990's when I was 13-14, by a male school teacher. This teacher was removed from the school, and is married to one of the other students involved. There is 3 other victims, that I am aware of, 2 have taken their lives in the past several years. I'd managed to cope with it, mostly by shuttering it away. I'd had some counselling and AD's, but was mostly okay. Fast forward to ~2010, and this teacher is now the Deputy Mayor. I kid you not. I mention to the Mayor, who I had a relatively good relationship with, that this was causing harm to myself and other victims. Instead of getting support, I started getting legal threats. Constantly ever since. """"Speak up and you'll be put in jail"""" I'm told, again and again and again. A week ago I called the Mayor, and told him I felt he should step down from his position. That it was causing emotional harm to victims, even if he did not mean for that outcome. So 6am this morning, two Police knock on my door and serve me with an AVO. Aren't police, who are aware the case is being investigated by several parties (including Police) supposed to be on our side? It's one thing to be getting threats from the teacher, and his friends - but when Police rock up and start carrying on about sending me to jail, it's a tough one to accept. I just don't feel like there's anyone you can turn to. Now that even the Police are helping intimidate me, I'm just lost. I am seeing a psycoligist (paid for by the education department) and getting AD's prescribed by my GP - but my goodness, I can see how people decide to take their own lives (something I'd never been able to get my head around many years ago - """"how could it be """"that"""" bad I used to think!"""""",ptsd-trauma";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Feeling stupid & embarrassed re reaction to trigger,UID386,Attended meeting at church discussing scriptures. Unfortunately person leading group started using bushfires as an example to illustrate the point he was making. There was nothing wrong with what he said for anyone else and I could see the point he was making. I managed to stay where I was although uncomfortable for a short while but then further comments were too much and I walked out feeling embarrassed for making a fool of myself and extremely anxious and upset both due to what was said and then my over reaction to it. I was trapped in a bushfire as a child so reminders of bushfires is a trigger for me. One minute I think I'm doing better and then something like this happens and I feel like I'll never overcome the problem. My reactions are so inconsistent which makes it harder to deal with it logically. any ideas to help me react better would be helpful,ptsd-trauma;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Struggling with summer- Fire alerts and risk of sunburn.,UID386,""I am finding summer difficult. I started exposure therapy for PTSD related to bushfires I was trapped in a bushfire which destroyed our house as a 10 year old, In those day I am supposed to read articles about bushfires each day as part of the exposure therapy which has brought everything to the surface combine as that with Christmas so I don't see my therapist for several weeks to debrief and we have hot weather with Total fire ban days and frequent reports on the radio re fires. As a child I was badly sunburnt several times. I was home from school with severe sunburn on the day of the fires so I am hypervigilent re sunburn risk ie won't go out in the sun without long sleeves & trousers or skirt Sunscreen isn't enough. Hence I cant relax at the beach or pool when it is hot. I used to enjoy swimming (in the shade or late in the day when the sun is going down but my husband is now blind so I have to watch him in the water constantly and give him directions which way to go. I used to work through summer but stopped work several months ago as it was too stressful as I was really stressed, a colleague didn't like me and often complained about me to my face and my husband kept getting sick so I was exhausted looking after him. He had surgery in July which was supossed to reduce the risk of him choking/aspirating but it failed and the tube was reiserted 5 times before we gave up and never wnt back to the hospital after the last time.

New Has anyone had treatment for PTSD for trauma experienced decades ago,UID386,Hi I have experienced depression & anxiety for years and sought medical help more recently as it escalated. I recently gave up work as it became too difficult to cope while caring for my husband whose medical condition has deteriorated recently. My psych recommended treatment for PTSD but I am now feeling more stressed & anxious as it is stirring up really bad memories and feelings. It also means there isn't time to focus on other things which are causing stress and increasing depression. I feel like there are are so many negative thoughts and feelings in my mind I am overwhelmed. The initial trauma occurred when I was 10 but there has been other experiences as an adult which had the potential to cause the same problem. (I usually go somewhere I feel safer and only return home when the I feel it is safe.),ptsd-trauma;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Stomach/digestion health anxiety,UID322,""Hi, So I know this isn't the place to get a proper medical diagnosis or anything like that, but I just wanted to share what has been happening with me lately in-case if maybe someone else has experienced similar issues in the past and can give me some insight because this issue has been bothering me quite a lot lately. (and just a fair warning this post talks about poop so if you don't like that kind of stuff click away now) So for a month or so now, I've been pretty anxious that something is wrong with my digestive system. I'm not sure what, but it doesn't seem right. My reasoning for thinking this is because my stool (#2) hasn't been the usual brown colour for 2 or so months now, but a yellowish or sometimes even greenish colour... I've gone to the doctors and mentioned this to them 3 times in the past, but every time they brush it off as being nothing but an 'excess of fat' in my diet and don't investigate it any further and act like it's nothing to worry about. I did, however, get an abdominal ultrasound not too long ago for unrelated issues which came up clean, and I've also gotten quite a few blood tests looking for stomach ulcers and other things like that. This really bothers me because I want them to investigate it further, but they don't seem to think it's necessary even though I've brought the same issue up with them on 3 different occasions. So pretty much what I want to know is, is it normal to have yellowish #2s for such a long time? I do admit that my diet probably is on the high side when it comes to fat due to getting takeout quite a lot, but I'm not sure if that's the issue or if it could possibly be something else... I do get dull pains every once and a while just under my ribs where I imagine my kidneys would be, but the pain is never severe and I suspect it's just digestion pains but it's worrisome none-the-less. I would google all my symptoms myself, but I've made it a rule that I don't google symptoms anymore because I always without a doubt focus on the worst-case-scenario that google shows me which just adds to my anxiety instead of helping it. If someone else could take the symptoms I mentioned and google them for me and come back here with some info, that would be appreciated. If there are any nurses/doctors on these forums, I would love to hear what your opinion is. Do you think I should go back to the doctors and be adamant about getting further tests, or could it just be excess fat causing the issues? Thank you."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"No motivation, no idea,UID322,""Hi guys, it's been a while since I've made a post on here. A quick update on me is that my health anxiety is nowhere near as severe and as frequent as it used to be, although this whole Corona Virus thing has got me on edge admittedly. (I'm not sure if this post belongs in the anxiety section, if not feel free to move it.) Anyways, this post is about motivation, or rather my severe lack of it. I've been stuck in the same spot since leaving Highschool. I haven't held down a job, I haven't studied anything, and I haven't done much of anything for a good 3+ years of my life now except sit at home. The problem is I have no clue whatsoever where to even start... and even if I did I doubt I'd have to motivation to actually do that thing... I'm stuck. I have no idea what to do with my life. I want to study, but don't know what to study, and don't want to make the wrong decision. I want to work, but my anxiety makes the jobs I'd actually be comfortable doing very few and far between. I'm seeing all my family and friends grow up around me, getting jobs, learning to drive, and actually get somewhere in life and here I am still stuck at square one. I'm sick and tired of relying on my parents when it comes to pretty much everything. I'm nearly 21 and still feel like a child in so many aspects of life. I'm losing hope for my future and fast. I used to look forward to my birthdays, but now all they do is mark another year of me doing nothing with my life. If you told me 5 years ago that my biggest challenge in life would be depression &amp";" anxiety I would have laughed in your face, but now they pretty much control everything I do and every decision I make. If there's anyone on here that has been in a similar situation, I'd very much love to hear how you got out of it. I'm really at a loss of what to do. Thank you."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Nausea & Anxiety,UID322,""Hi, One thing I've been struggling with consistently due to my anxiety is nausea, and it's taking a toll on my life. In the mornings, I can't eat breakfast for the life of me, I have 0 appetite whatsoever and if I try to force myself to eat something I'll just get nauseous, my stomach will hurt, I'll dry heave or sometimes even vomit. I can drink stuff without a problem so I usually just have a glass of water and an Up &amp";" Go , but eating anything solid even if it's my favorite food in the world just leads to nausea which is the last thing I want to start my day off with. Not being able to eat breakfast for me isn't a major problem and I can (and have) lived with it for many years now, the main issue I want to try and get sorted is not being able to brush my teeth because it feels like my gag reflex is in overdrive. If the toothbrush goes anywhere near the back of my mouth I will get nauseated, gag, and sometimes throw up, which is super unpleasant and makes me really not want to brush my teeth and my dental hygiene has suffered a lot over the years because of it. I've found that all I can really do is floss my teeth and use mouthwash which I know isn't good enough dental hygiene but I'm at a loss of what else to do. I have to pick between having good dental hygiene or gagging several times every time I go to brush my teeth. Because of this, I only really brush my teeth when I really have to, like before going to socialize with friends or go out for dinner, etc... I'm worried that if I don't find a solution to this problem I'll be without any teeth by the age of 30... they're already in pretty bad shape now and I'm not even 21... Has anyone else experienced these issues and particularly the brushing the teeth one? If so, have you found any solution that works for you? I'd love to hear it!

"Christmas -  with anxiety/depression,UID453,""8 November 2019 Hi all ...any old buddies on here will know I can't bear this """"festive season"""", not the day itself, by which time it's quiet, with folks already doing what they planned and no more hype or pressure. I thought I was avoiding the dreaded """"lead up"""" but it's started already. I am now overtaken by panic and anxiety flooding my whole being, after months of coping relatively well and healthy. my family and grand kids live in another UID2254ty, and travelling there costs a lot. The parents don't get much time off at this time of year, they have a small home, so I try and find accommodation (which always goes up sky high in Peak Times). I don't get to see them often at all...and need to make contact with the kids before they get much older and I won't even know them. working out dates, times etc to travel, hopefully before the tourist rush starts....has me in a really bad way. The earlier you book plane trips in my regional town, the cheaper it is. If I leave it till just a few days before, the cost will be out of my reach. I have to watch my finances these days...and combined with Xmas presents for the kids my head is spinning and I am terrified. I can't think straight.....what stores to buy the presents from? will I just send money to contribute to the present if I can't get there in person? My son is not the best communicator and doesn't realise I need every little detail worked out (he doesn't know how bad my anxiety is) I need dates, times, which brands and size the presents have to be etc etc To finish up, (and I hope I haven't bored you to tears) I am terrified, can't make decisions, frozen until I hear the family's timetables and advice....and afraid to tell them I am scared of spending too much money. They are my grand kids....I can't disappoint them? I am scared of spending money on travel, as well as the presents, but this means I won't see them in person....I miss them, I love them so much....why does Christmas tear people with anxiety and/or depression apart like this? contrary to the happy happy movies and ghastly Carols....there is no peace, no joy, no celebration...at least for me...just stress, financial difficulties, endless choices, time wasting shopping, searching online for travel deals...it's going to destroy me this year.......and I have been doing so well...back to square one with my panic and anxiety...all due to Christmas!!"",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Scared of ""trivial, everyday"" things,UID453,""Does anyone else share this irrational, stupid, inconvenient anxiety? It doesn't happen all the time but when it does I cannot explain it or know what to do, to get rid of it. It will sound comical, laughable when I tell you but that's OK...it sounds funny to me also. I will start by saying there are certain situations I am active in, at which I exel, where the majority of folk would be terrified. I am brilliant there...and yet scared of this """"little stuff"""" . For months I was frightened of going to a different petrol station nearby. Prices went sky high at most places in my town, and this one was cheaper, popular, accessible and an obvious choice and for months I put off going there...because I was scared of it. Which bowser should I pull up at? Which buttons do I push to key in the dollars I want?. What if there is a big queue?...so I eventually had to ask a neighbour (who is familiar with anxiety problems) to go with me, just to sit beside me and quietly tell me what to do. Otherwise I would never have """"mastered the petrol station""""! Yesterday i bought a new vacuum cleaner. It was a good price, I am pleased with it, I want to use it asap and need to use it. I look forward to using it. I am scared to get it out of the box. What if I can't understand the instructions in the manual? It's different from my last one. see how stupid it sounds? I am scared of my vacuum cleaner!!!! and yet if you could see what I achieved just recently in a specialised field...you would be amazed at my competency and confidence!!! WHY am I scared of these trivial everyday things? God knows how long it will take for me to begin assembling that vacuum cleaner which I know, logically, I am intelligent enough to figure out!! So why am I procrastinating about it? What is wrong with me? Who could help me? Any suggestions or thoughts would be very welcome......have a nice day.....

"Anxiety deriving from a low form of 'ptsd'?,UID327,""Hello everyone, I just wanted to post this thread in hopes that someone who has had similar experiences with this to provide tactics/solutions. I know this may sound like an insignificant thing to be anxious about, but I feel the need to mention it because it is affecting me. I have really bad driving anxiety - more specifically, with traffic lights (when they turn yellow, and the amount of time they remain yellow). Everytime a traffic light turns yellow even within the distance where its clearly better to go, my heart just starts palpitating like crazy"; I can feel it going all throughout my body including my head, and also makes me feel like i'm gasping for air and that I can't breath. Oh, and most times when a yellow light appears, I lock the breaks, which isn't safe either. I don't know if this is worth mentioning: this all pretty much started to happen the first time I locked up on a yellow light. people where looking and laughing at me. At that time, it wasn't even a lack of ability to spatially judge - it had happened because I got lost and was paying attention to the roads rather than the lights;" I never had an issue with effective judgement prior to this. It's almost like I lost that ability when it happened. It's hard to 'just practice' to get rid of this mannerism, since there are serious consequences in failing. That being said, it makes trying to get rid of this anxiety really difficult. Nothing I've done (exposure therapy) has really helped me in anyway. I'm unsure of what to do. Anyways, I hope I have made sense, and that someone can help me with this matter. Thanks everyone. Happy new year!

"Christmas anxiety and conflict,UID799,""Well by now members here either had a good happy Christmas or they didn't. Upon reflection how was yours? For decades my sister and I endured Christmas's of turmoil, conflict and hidden frustration. We had one member of our family that had no idea what life would be like if she just enjoyed her children and grandchildren- our mother. It was only when my sister and I reached our 50's we decided we would put in boundaries to adverse behaviour to try and protect our children from abuse and hopefully have a calm Xmas gathering. That didnt happen so 9 years ago we severed our relationship with her completely. Radical? Maybe but our Christmas gatherings without her have since been 100% comfortable and includes laughter and love. This is one example of controlling your own life. Toxic people, yes even parents, have no room in our lives now, we simply wont tolerate it. Why? Why not tolerate other people that are annoying? Well there are limits. We often discuss here about people that likely have or do have a mental illness that wont seek help. Such people in the end, we cannot help so it becomes a """"do we tolerate them or do we reject them""""? Rejection is a tough action but it can become so toxic that there is no other option or your life becomes a ruined state. As leader of our own little families with kids we decided to protect them and ourselves. It isnt easy knowing your parent is now elderly and we wont see again. We hear from others how she is fairing, her anger of us etc, we have to allow others to express as long as they have no demands of us. But in the end we must control our own lives and be decisive, yet I know of other families that every Xmas they have conflict. Such conflict would not occur if one party stayed away for the day. One friend has done just that, he will not attend his family gathering Xmas day to avoid the yelling and UID524che. He indeed waits till the 27th to visit his parents and sister. He has never felt it was a bad move. Christmas day if not a happy day is a wasted day. It brings up old wounds. Many people would suspend the day but they feel their opposition will """"win"""" by having the day with family, it should not be a competition, in fact, you win by being mature and taking the better stance and avoiding the UID863ting. So next year think hard about how you are going to spend Xmas day. If you have a mental illness think about protecting yourself from any conflict. Do you have any thoughts on this and recommendations? "",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I am just exhausted and lost,UID501,""Hi I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to help and read. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression over a long period of my life and I am in my mid 30's. I have been thinking about a few things and I really don't know how to go about it so I turn to here. My experiences have been positive. I have had 2 break downs and the one thing that really gets to me as I get older are feeling the tremors, especially in my hands. I can just have days where I am so shaky and have no idea what to do with my hands. Today I sat and just grasped them together. My whole body can get shaky at times. There is no p panic attack. It just trembled. It is frustrating and tiring. If you have any ideas please let me know and I would so appreciate any tips. Also there have been more bad then good days the last few weeks. I am just not myself. I know my job ended and I did fall down but I got back up considering how I usually am. But I am starting to wonder and get frustrated with the roller coaster of anxiety and depression. I am up and down. I am starting with a new psychiatrist in the new year and am seeing a counsellor as psychologists just didn't help . My family has a really bad genetic pre disposition for major depression and anxiety at an extreme level. I just don't know or want to have to deal with this forever, but I think I will. I know there are ways to help and I have tried so many. I know medications have to be changed as the body gets use to them and I just wonder when this will all be over with. I don't know why so many people suffer with this and it seems to not look like improving. The stigma is still there and it is frustrating. Even if I see a new GP as I have I feel like I am proving myself not to be another pill popping junkie. I hate proving and explaining myself. Having depression and anxiety is a job. I am hoping to start work in the new year and pick up my study again. Because you have to have that piece of paper to show you can do it. I have a degree but I want to move into a new field but it seems my mental illness gets in the way. I have tried mindfulness, exercise, using phone lines, attending group sessions and the list goes on. I am not trying to be UID4516tive but I just don't want to be stuck with this forever or stuck full stop. For Christmas I would just want my present to be my anxiety and depression to go away. Thank you for reading and helping. I truly appreciate it."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Managing my Anxiety Through 12 Months of Cyber Bullying,UID1321,""I would have been totally destroyed if not for the Beyond Blue forums during the past 12 months. The tips and tricks have helped me stay sane when some days I was sure I would end up curled on the floor. Thanks to those who had nice things to say to my posts. The big takeaways for me were to try and stay in the present moment and use the acceptance and commitment therapy tricks. '' They really helped. So thanks folks. I figure I have a few more years of this bullying unless a miracle happens. The past few weeks have been difficult, my chest is tight with pain most days. But I get through. I have never let on what has happened. Basically some very nasty people created fake social media wrote things about on the internet in my name. When you search my name, the bad stuff comes up first. When employers search for me, the see the nasty things first - and of course they click on it, thus making it even more popular. Cyber bullies know how to manipulate the internet. Google's algorithm sees that people click on the nasty things and figure they are the most useful things to return in a search. Of course nobody clicks on the good stuff, otherwise it wouldn't be a problem. Anyway, to anyone else going through this, stay in the moment and stay close to what really matters."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Scared to get into the work force for the first time.,UID529,""Okie Dokie, i desperately need to get a job soon but i have numerous problems in regards to getting and maintaining a job which gives me severe anxiety and i UID2087iberately avoid searching and applying for a job. First, i have no mental support. I have little to none close people in my life that are available or caring enough to reassure me and support me, so i'm on my own. Worst case scenario, i have to go to a job interview my myself. Second, my transport options are inadequate. I only have my learners and don't get much opportunities to practice so i can only take the bus and walk. Annoying thing about the bus is that they're only available every half and hour so depending on the time i could be late or too early (i hate being in public) and my physicality is atrocious. A mere 5 minutes of walking takes its toll... Thirdly, I'm Autistic. Fourthly, jobs don't feel secure to me? With school you're pretty much cemented a spot but with a job i feel i'd find it so hard to relax, especially considering the bitchy work place environments my mum describes! I'm scared to find myself stuck in a nasty employee environment. So far those are my concerns with getting a job, i did have some work experience and as much i didn't enjoy the work itself the people there were lovely. I hope i strike lucky and get a nice job but... yea, i'm scared."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Feeling hopeless,UID386,""Hi guys, I'm new here. Trying to reach out. Recently, i've been crying my eyes out for small things. Actually it all started when I kept failing my exams. I'm a university student. Moved to a different country because my parents thought we will have a better future. All they want is for me to graduate. And I can't seem to do that. I keep failing. I haven't told them that I failed and they are expecting me to graduate this coming March. I don't know what to do. Ever since I failed, I kept feeling sad, crying every night. I can't help but to compare myself to my friends who have already graduated and are successful. I appreciat my parents, they only want me to graduate, and I already failed once. Ever since, they have been comparing me to my other friends who have already graduated and are successful. I get scared when they see a post from their family friend who had a child who recently graduated because I know that they will pressure me more. One time, my dad suddenly got angry because I still haven't graduated. I am still stuck, worthless and a failure. I've always had a low self-esteem. Maybe from all the criticisms that I always get from my parents that I only realized recently. I always feel so inferior. I work nowadays and my mental state is causing a problem. I don't like going to work because I feel like everyone is just going to judge me and look down on me. I get palpitations whenever I am on my way to work. I don't know what my problem is. I just feel so useless. A failure. Thats all I see in my parent's eyes. I have to tell them the truth soon. And I am panicking. I've been thinking so much about suicide but I've been trying so hard to come up with ways to live on. Like getting a new course that can make me motivated. Or just move out from my parent's house because I know as long as I am under their roof, I will always feel insecure and pressured. But still, the suicidal thoughts have been increasing. I don't know what to do. I want to live but I am afraid of the future. I don't want to feel this way anymore."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Worry worry worry part 2,UID799,""Hi again, In part one we dealt with """"worry"""" and how non productive it is except for giving us ulcers. Here I'd like to explore other ways of reducing worry. Commonly we tend to tackle challenges on our own, many of us don't like passing on responsibilities to others, it causes us to feel we are cheating by getting others to do our work, how realistic is this? Take a factory for example. If two machine operators do the same work but one operator is supplied with a different order that places twice the volume of work onto the operator left. Changes would be needed like overtime or a third operator to work the machine during lunch hour. What I'm suggesting is when workloads are raised there needs to be changes like water finds it own level, so should workload. This leads to speaking up. Asking for help if you are snowed under with tasks is something you need to consider. Your partner or family members aren't mind readers. They could be lounging watching TV as you UID17eat over a hot stove, then the dog attacks a cyclist so you are out there chaining him up then your meal burns and you fall on your bed with resentment that """"he didnt even help me"""". Instead """"please darling can you tend to the dog, I'm cooking at the moment"""". Delegation can be so easy yet we dont often do it. The other mention is prioritizing. Some people are terrible at this. My first wife was a slow worker. She'd take 60 minutes to hang out the washing after I hung it out as I never hung it out """"correctly"""". During that time I'd mind the children and be late for work. Things got way out of proportion and nothing was prioritized. Some people cannot co-ordinate tasks. eg the washing of dirty dishes is priority over mowing the lawn unless rain is close by. Hygiene more important than vanity and so on. If you think your prioritizing is non existent then ask an older person how to change. That not only makes you more efficient but your partner will no longer carry the burden of such absence of planning. As worry reduces smiling increases. Laughter returns and your heart will not give up early entering your twilight years. Such steps along with appropriate medication and therapy will get your life back on track.

"This has helped me with anxiety,UID1321,""Not sure if you are allowed to post links, so instead I will suggest you look for this yourself. It more or less backs up a few of the things that are tips on this forum. When I feel anxiety creeping back into my life I use this technique to keep it under control. Search YouTube for 10 steps to improve your memory by London Real. While the focus is on improving memory, the step where they talking about 'killing ANTs (automatic UID4516tive thoughts)' is similar to what you will see elsewhere about acceptance and commitment therapy. In this case, they say all this UID4516tivity that creates ANXIETY has a detrimental affect on your health, as your body does not know the difference between real threats or fears, or perceived threats or fears. So to LOOK AFTER YOURSELF you need to get rid of the UID4516tive thoughts.

"I'm so scared,UID3845,""The week before last the world was pretty great. I was loving my job, walking every day when I got home and planning fun things to do. Then something hit me like a massive wave. It completely knocked me off my feet and I've fallen into fear. I've never before felt so bad that I wanted to call a help line, but this time I did. I talk to my partner, but I just felt like I wanted to talk to anyone and just cry and I think in the back of my mind I was hoping someone would have a magic answer. But of course there is no magic answer. I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of waking up, of going to work, of talking to people, of coming home. I'm scared to eat food, I'm scared that I have some sort of terrible disease or illness. I need to go to the dentist, but I'm scared he's going to tell me all my teeth are falling out or that I have some sort of disease in my mouth. I'm scared of medication too which makes all of this even harder. I'm scared of losing people, I'm scared of dying and I'm scared that the world is becoming a horrible horrible place.​ I'm also so incredibly scared that this is it. This is my life now and I will never get rid of these thoughts. Because they aren't just fears when I'm faced with them. These are the things I think about constantly. I'm imagining the things I have to do in the future and I'm terrified to do them. I just want to be normal. I want to wake up in the morning and worry about which shoes to wear. I want to feel hungry at lunch time and really enjoy a good meal.

fear of studying;" fear of the inability to learn.,UID327,""Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my experience with something I've been dealing with for a while, if it is even an actual thing, furthermore- if other people have experienced it too. Basically, I've always been afraid of learning, or rather- the possible inability to learn (to not take forever to learn something). I've never gone past '80%' of my potential for the fear that the last '20%' of my abilities aren't worth it";" I fear that my best efforts may never be even as productive as someone's ''I wasn't really trying'' amount of effort. I believe this insecurity of being not being intelligent enough stems from how much I value my mind. Is there even a correlation between intelligence and sentience or a measure of how much of a person a person is? I mean you can program computer to be able to- answer questions, calculate or even create, at that point- that computer is probably the most intelligent being, regardless- it's still not of value as a human being. The point is- I don't think intelligence is a measure of a person's worth as a human. My question to you- Is this valid? or is this just my preconceived bias in play? Thanks everyone. I hope I made sense. :)"",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Health Anxiety & Bronchitis,UID322,""Hi guys, A short backstory: For the past month I've been on several different sets of antibiotics for several different things, which has really been stressing me out. The main one I've been worried about is bronchitis, which all started when I coughed up some grey/black phlegm which I knew wasn't right, I've been on 2 sets of antibiotics for it already. Which brings me to this point. I'm still noticing little bits of black phlegm here and there even after all these antibiotics. I'm trying my hardest to convince myself that it's probably just remnants of the infection and that it'll probably clear up soon and the doctor even said it should clear up within a week, but I'm still stressing over it almost constantly. I'm coughing on purpose every so often just to check if there's any black phlegm, and 99% of the time there isn't but then I'll cough up a tiny bit and get thrown right back into the loop. There have been at least 4 times in the past few weeks where I've gone """"I'm finally getting better!"""" only to see more black phlegm and get worried again. The thought that keeps popping up in my head is """"what if it's lung cancer?"""" because I stupidly googled the symptoms, and of course one of the things that popped up about black phlegm is that it could be a sign of lung cancer. I smoked weed pretty often for around two years or so but stopped smoking it a few weeks before the black phlegm popped up and haven't touched it since, so now I'm worried sick that maybe the smoking has lead to lung cancer. I'm regretting ever smoking anything at all and am pretty confident that even if it ends up just being bronchitis I will never smoke again or at the very least very very occasionally. On my last visit to the doctors, they also took my pulse and my blood pressure, both of which they said were high, which has got me worrying about that stuff too which isn't helping. I've had Health Anxiety for over a year now, but this time it's different. UID2432ore I'd have imagined symptoms that I couldn't actually see, but this time with the black phlegm I can actually see the symptom, which stresses me out even more. If there is anyone with any knowledge of bronchitis (nurses, doctors, people who have had bronchitis before) and could shed some light on what might be happening or maybe share similar experiences they've had, that could really help me out. I think at this point I'll wait maybe 1 or 2 more days and if I still see black phlegm I'll go in for the chest x-ray. Thankyou"",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"A distressing day ,UID322,""So today has been pretty difficult for me so far. Some background is I've had nasal polyps for a few months now, but they have never really caused me any worry- until this morning. I went to blow my nose and a little bit of mucus with blood in it came out, and my nose was bleeding a little bit. I then stupidly googled 'blood nose and nasal polyps' and of course, one of the things Google says it 'could' be is cancer. Great. UID2349 my mind is going crazy and I can't think of anything but that, I went to my friend's house and found it extremely difficult to socialize, I pretty much just stayed silent and was in my head the whole time. On the bright side of things, this rather distressing experience finally pushed me to go down to my GP and book both a normal consult to check up on my nose, and a mental health care plan for Monday next week. I'm seriously considering just going down to the GP tonight (it closes at 10pm) and getting my nose checked then because I'm really concerned. It could very well be (and most likely is) just a slight nose bleed caused by the abnormally hot day (28 degrees compared to 20ish degree days usual), but that still doesn't stop me from being anxious of it. This isn't really a question, I'm just really anxious right now and want to voice my concerns. Let's just say I can't wait for the GP visit tomorrow and see what the doctor has to say. I really need to get out of the habit of self-diagnosing myself because it just makes me panic even when I might have no reason to be panicking at all. I hope that's the case.

"How to ease imagined symptoms? (Health anxiety),UID322,""So a bit of backstory is a few months ago I had my first run-in with health anxiety, I pretty much tricked myself into thinking I had this or that and visited the GP like 10 times in a month for various random things... What I've noticed is that when I'm occupied or busy doing something else (have my mind focusing on something else), I have no symptoms whatsoever, but the second I 'check' myself to see if I'm feeling those symptoms still, they magically re-appear. This is exactly what I was doing a few months ago too and it was miserable. I believe this type of thinking is called 'self-destructive' thinking, basically me assuming the worst when I feel any sort of sensation I don't recognize. My rational thinking says I'm completely fine and it's just placebo, but there's always that thought in the back of my head saying 'what if it isn't?'. This time around it's nowhere as severe as the first time I had it, but I'm worried that if it continues I might spiral again and that's the last thing I want as the last time I had it was the most miserable I've been in a very long time. So my question is, what are some good techniques to stop yourself from thinking that way and tricking yourself into feeling these symptoms? Any and all tips and help is very appreciated.

I honestly don't know where to start. My anxiety has flared up after a couple of years of managing my symptoms. I was lucky enough to be able to come off medication, however I am now needing UID3156 to help me sleep. I never wanted to be back here again. Sigh. The constant thoughts and feelings of fear and failure is really getting me down. It affecting my sleep and my relationship. And, don't get me starterd on my UID3984 UID17ings, they are exhausting! I originally recognised that I had aniexty (and it's cousin, depression) after loosing my dad, who was my world, even in my 30's. During his illness, I was his carer, however i look back and wish I could have done more. I knew at the time that I was giving all I could without loosing me completely. Anyway, I digress. During dads sickness there was family fewd's as well, not directed at me, all around me. Since then I have discovered that I had blocked out a lot of childhood memories to cope, these were emotional struggles that I had experienced as a result of events throughout my childhood ( emotional events) . Although I have grown and learnt a lot about myself, these feelings still haunt me and I find that I no longer cope as well, to the point that I stress over things that I may have said and done during the day, it almost an obsession. I also learnt that I work in a toxic workplace but I can't quit as the fear of starting somewhere new is unbearable. I practice mindfulness, excercise, write my thoughts down and In the past have seen a psychologist. I don't know if I have the energy to go back to a psychologist or seek online courses , I would really just would like to sleep for a week uninterrupted and to not need medication just to get a few hours quality sleep.

"Anxiety, how l eliminated it,UID799,""Its a very common topic on this forum, anxiety and its long list of symptoms. I grew up in a highly strung household. Screams without notice and unreachable expectations...took their toll. So when a major workplace event came along at 27yo my anxiety came to roost. Its peak was reached. I visited my GP and therapy commenced and lasted 12 months. My therapist identified l needed the following- Awareness of the severity of my anxiety Reprogramming of my thoughts like thinking realistic thoughts Stop worrying Learning relaxation Rehabilitated into a diffetent profession. He was correct. Add to that, medication for 12 years to """"help me on my way"""" My change of career went from local law enforcement (where it was full of controversy) to a supervisor of adults with mental illness difficulties in a sheltered workshop. Some years later a friend told me about Maharaji Prem Rawat and copied tapes of his speeches. My relaxation up till now was using muscle tensioning exercises at night, now l also listen to this fabulous man. Later I'd google his youtube videoes. Maharaji sunset Maharaji the perfect instrument. And many more. So what other measures?. Well l began to rid my life of toxic people, change my environment to the country, grow vitamin packed vegetables and fruit, revamp finances and utilise direct debit (less bills in the mail, less surprises) and increased my positive thinking by attending motivation lectures. By 2012 my anxiety was no longer measurable. Yes 25 years. Do readers think it would only take a short time? Likely yes, because l did. Like other ailments, a pill alone isnt enough, relaxation alone not enough and so on. Its the combination of many things that was most effective for me . Undertaking a review of all facets of your life is essential for recovery. And dont be alarmed if you try something and it doesnt work. Eg Cognitive therapy didnt work for me but l read here that some have had success. As it turned out in 2009 it was discovered l had bipolar2 depression and dysthymia. The same personal approach was made. Never give up, review my environment, review friendships, lower stress, lower debt, have a 5 and 10 year plan for goals etc Sometimes subtle changes are needed like introducing a sport or hobby, sometimes radical ideas like relocating or career change. Whatever is needed put all options on the table. Anxiety the mental illness deserves nothing less than your full attention. What works for you.?

Binge eating disorder,UID2400,Ive always been a comfort eater for as long as i can remember but didn't realise alot of what i do is binge eating until a few months ago. Today after reading the dsm5 diagnosis criteria thing it comfirmed i have binge eating disorder. I'm secretly ashamed and embarrased to have this. I'm struggling with the term disorder with it cause it makes me feel like it's something people can never get control of. I would love to know peoples experiences with it.

"There is no such thing as a little bit of ocd,UID2400,""I regularly here from people that they have """"a little bit of ocd"""" or """"im ocd in the house""""ect. THERE IS NO SUCH THING! Its got to the point i say i have real ocd not fake ocd. I know these people have no idea about the illness so they don't know any better but its very disrespectful to what is a very debilitating illness.

"My journey the past 6 weeks. I'll update as changes occur,UID1321,""You might be interested in hearing how I get through the next few weeks. So I'm journaling it. Some background. I was really struggling with stressful job after job. I quit in October last year because it was all coming in on me. I spent the first 3 months trying to heal. Then the anxiety returned as I realised I needed money and a job. Late February and March were awful. I was driven to tears many times. I started to really get better at self awareness and acceptance and commitment therapy. Out of the blue in late March, I got an offer from a job I was turned down for. So I took it. Well, it was out of the pot into the frying pan. It was so stressful and I made mistake after mistake. It took all my strength not to fall in to a heap. I ended up taking a day off to cope with the stress. Eventually it eased as the project I was on went into a lag period prior to turning on. Well it went live this week and it's a mess. I am really struggling again. I have taken today off. After UID1997 (I realise it isn't showing great courage) I felt guilty, and felt really stressed. Trying to stay in the present moment at the moment is difficult. I had no sleep last night worrying about the damage I caused through my mistakes. Today I plan to try and walk for 3 hours to get rid of the stress hormones. I will try to get into the present moment. I plan to focus on eating better, getting into the present moment, and exercise. If I can get through the next 2 weeks without breaking down it will be a serious UID3600tory. I will keep you informed."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Depersonalisation (Out of body experience),UID73,""Hi All, I know that this is a rare symptom associated with anxiety. I have been extremely stressed as of late and have been experiencing depersonalisation, the only way that I can explain is that it is like I am trapped in my head or watching myself talk to someone else or communicate. What makes it worse is that I notice myself noticing myself if that makes sense. I can still do everyday things like drive to work, speak to friends and family however when I am not distracted I notice myself questioning if things are real, is this a dream, instead of doing actions automatically it is as though I am having to tell myself and watch myself do it. Where someone would speak to another person about something I feel as though I am speaking and listening at the same time.

"Anxiety. What’s worked for me during the past 20 years,UID1321,""I read a lot of the forum posts. I answer a lot too. I have lived with anxiety for decades. At time it has been debilitating. So, I thought perhaps my remedies and tactics might be a benefit to others. Firstly, I had my first epitome when a doctor explained what is happening medically to us when we suffer from anxiety, and medically, what is required. So basically, we have a situation that activates the fight of flight in us, spilling way too much cortisol in our bodies. We are pumped up on this drug, and no amount of logic will get it to go away. We need to get rid of the cortisol, or bring it down to manageable levels. I use hard exercise to soak it up. Once it starts to soak it up, I can then use logic to bring my thoughts under control. I use the mindfulness tactic to start with. That is, bring yourself into the present moment. Look this is a lot easier to say than actually do. It takes months of practice, and when my head is spinning, it is very hard to bring myself into the moment. But believe me, when you master this, it is so satisfying. Regularly during the day I check in on myself and notice my feelings. If I am happy or sad, I notice this and label it. “This is sadness I am feeling right now”. Sometimes, just by noticing things and labelling them, the feeling seems to go away. “I am feeling angry right now”, seems to make anger go away. The next thing is to recognise the cause of most of the problem is fear. I go straight to the cause. Why am I afraid? And, I have actively measured my instincts over the years, and my gut instinct is not very good. I have learned not to trust what I’m feeling, because it’s usually wrong. Your gut might be better than mine. Finally, I use the tactic counsellors give you with acceptance and commitment therapy. That is, when bad thoughts about the past or the future come into my head, I acknowledge their presence, and then tell them they are free to stay there, but I refuse to engage with them. “I notice I am having bad thoughts about work tomorrow. Those thoughts can stay in my head, but I’m not going to think about them or have a conversation or argument with them.” I hope you can get some benefit from this."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Anxiety -mind over matter,UID799,""We've heard the saying """"mind over matter"""", that is to be mentally strong enough to endure lifes challenges like abuse, rejection, mental daily challenges and even basic action like going outdoors to shop. One of the many problems with anxiety, that was highlighted in1987 during my first therapy session was realism. He asked me regularly when I mentioned my thoughts during the week- """"is that realistic""""? 90% of the time it wasn't hence, an anxious mental state. Eg I wont park in a one hour zone to enter a newsagents or I might get a parking fine. Unrealistic as I'd only be there 5 minutes. I wont take a train into the UID2254ty as there might be a train strike and I'd be stranded. Getting things into perspective is a key to recovery with anxiety. What about """"matter over mind""""? It is another theory of mine. Many times during my decades of anxiety now largely conquered, I'd question my ability to carry out a basic task like driving to a town I not often visited. Yet when I finally found the courage the task proved easy. Some of this process involves changing our mind Google Beyondblue Topic UID17itching mindsets Essentially that theme is to allow your physical actions to commence a task BEFORE you think too much about it, knowing that it is my minds anxious makeup that is enabling me to feel I cant do those tasks. Mind over matter is an impossible thinking process if it is beyond your capability. """"Matter over mind"""" is more possible by temporarily detaching your over thinking, over analysing mind. A process more likely within your capability. It is a different path to the same objective...to overcome our unrealistic fears that can lead us back towards a normal life. Freedom from anxiety took me 30 years. Matter over mind had a significant role in that recovery. "",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"anxious about school camp?,UID3739,""i don’t know why i’m feeling this way, but all i can think about recently is my school camp. it’s still months away but for the past few weeks it’s all that’s been on my mind and i’m so worried. i’m 15 and i’ve been on school camps before with little to no issues, but recently i fell down a deep hole of mental health struggles and i know it may be stupid but my cat really helped me with getting over these struggles- or at least toning them down a bit. i got my cat three months ago and i’ve already relied so heavily on him to calm down and remind myself that i have at least one reason to try, one reason to stay alive. i’m worried about leaving him for three days. i don’t know how i’m going to react when he’s not there to help me. recently i’ve become so stressed in social situations, even teachers have noticed and tried to send me to the school councillor. what if i feel too overwhelmed on camp and my cats not there to help me feel calmer during my anxious breakdowns? i already don’t sleep when i’m on school camps because i feel too nervous around everyone, and now i’m also going to have to try to sleep without him curling up next to me. it will be too strange. in my house, i’m the one that takes care of my cat too. what if my he gets sick when i’m gone? or what if he runs away and i never see him again? he’s an indoor cat and is only allowed out for around an hour a day when i’m outside with him. my siblings don’t see why i’m so clingy, what if they let him outside and he runs off? between the fear that i’ll be too overwhelmed at camp and the fear that i’ll leave for camp and never see him again, i can’t think of anything else. i would just like to clarify that i haven’t been to a doctor and had any mental illnesses diagnosed. my parents and teachers have recommended therapy/school councillors, but i’ve never gone to them. i feel too dumb expressing how i feel, because i hear myself and realise how insignificant my problems are. i hate feeling this way, but i also can’t bring myself to speak up anywhere that’s not online. i’m actually doing significantly better than i was a few months ago, but i know that the smallest things can send me down a spiral of feeling nothing and loneliness for weeks or months at a time. i’m worried that school camp will be the thing that sends me down that spiral, and i really don’t want to feel that way again. i need to go to the camp, but i don’t know how to get over my concerns."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Anxiety and overthinking dating and new relationships,UID1664,""I have been someone who's always overanalysed situations and overthought everything, eventually leading to a lot of anxiety. While this has always affected me on the academic front, lately I've found myself overthinking majorly when it comes to dating people. I've had a few horrible relationships, which definitely makes me feel paranoid and cynical about things. Recently I met a guy off tinder, and while I didn't expect much from the app, he turned out to be really nice, and we've been seeing each other for about more than 2 months now. And while I'm really happy when I'm around him and we have a really good time, and he seems very genuine and affectionate towards me, once I'm by myself and back to my routine, instead of looking forward to the next date I just get really anxious about things, about whether he likes me as much as I like him, whether he might be sleeping with other girls even though he said he doesn't use tinder. I keep thinking he's going to get sick of me soon and probably just ghost me. I'm constantly reading too much into each text he sends me, wondering why he doesn't reply sooner (despite the fact that he told me he barely texts people). The thing that worries me the most is that he's going to eventually see through these insecurities/paranoia and think I'm too much to handle.

"Panic attacks limited remedies,UID799,""Circa 1987 and a sharp chest pain led to a GP visit- diagnosis, heart attack (31yo). 3 months later a full test revealed it was a panic attack. Such is the severity of the chest pain. I eliminated anxiety. It took me 25 years. (search - anxiety, how I eliminated it). However last weekend although I didn't have chest pains I had my first panic attack in many years. I flew from Melb to Perth to support a school friend I've known for 52 years. He has terminal pancreatic cancer. He is in his 3rd year since diagnosis. A nervous flyer didn't help nor did being out of my comfort zone staying in someones home. On the 2nd day our chatting turned to his feelings for a lady he was intimately involved with. My friend is very rich and his voice got louder as he explained that he """"wont let any woman take his millions"""". Several times I asked him calmly to simmer down and why is he taking it out on me. He did not relent, I walked out. I'd like to tell you of the 60 seconds before I walked out. I went quiet, looked down (not at him), I was in a corner, I had a feeling in my head like hot water being poured over it...I was totally uncomfortable. Anywhere to go but not stay there. I left, walked 10km then flagged a taxi to the airport. I had a return ticket for two days later and couldn't make it earlier (long weekend) so resigned to the fact that I would sleep under bushes for two nights. Our car broke and my savings for this trip was soaked up till next pension day. I cared not. After some breathing and muscle exercises I fell asleep under the stars at the airport. 5am my mate rang. Reluctantly I answered, we worked out some differences, many apologies from him and I spent my time with him again. With some its """"flight or fight""""...with me its """"flight and flight""""...I run from situations when panic sets in. Been the same for 62 years. My sister has the same reaction. I now accept that this is me. There is little that can be done except time out. Time alone gives you fume release. In this case it gave my friend reflection time. He is also dying so his anger is at times uncontrollable. It also told me that keeping some relationships at arms length is an art in itself. The most important thing is not to do anything in excess. Massive spending, irresponsible driving and/or drinking etc Those things compound the situation. Care for yourself. In my case sleeping under the stars didn't hurt anyone. Allow time to heal the anxiety. Reflect, relax. It's all ok. "",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But they still haven’t rostered me on to work and they have issued rosters till the 13th of Jan. I know most people would just go call them and find out. Which I am going to do but I had plans to do something with my kids today and because I found out I wasn’t rostered it’s thrown me. I can’t and won’t leave the house. I feel sick. I am crying.

"work and anxiety - change career ,UID475,""Hi posting back as it's been a while lots of changes in life work and anxiety now working part time as full time got too much my current job just makes me feel I don't want to go back, this is my third week calling in sick, I've tried noting down reasons, fears and feelings I'm unable to put it to reason as to why just a lot of UID4516tivity and hate for the job. my GP has been very understanding and my psychologist appointment is next week though three weeks ago could not get any earlier just feels a lot of waiting and unable to process my thoughts. I've come to the conclusion that this job is not right for me through counseling with my psychologist - factors including the office / UID2254ty location travel / call centre / UID1864 job / 100% constant customer service and very fast paced and KPI's work environment i just need a change. part of it is just me (round peg square hole or round hole square peg) my partner feels I have some autistic traits due to some things I say and do and the way I think and my actions to situations, (currently looking into getting assessed) and feel this impacts how I interact with people and deal with situations and causes of some of the issues I'm facing. some of it I may be able to change just not sure how though other parts it's just me and also my upbringing. The UID1864 industry now leaves a bad taste after also issues with my previous UID1864 job, I'm feeling I need to change to something else. To add to that a sudden change in health early this year has limited me physically to what I can do. As a desperate """"I need to change things"""" I have booked in to get a license and white card with the hopes I can get some temp work with an agency with no experience (one agency I called I was told is possible) and totally different industry. I feel a bit uneasy making a major change and if it will help or lead me back to wanting to running away and hide my question is have other people found a career change a positive to reducing / eliminating anxiety and if other steps are needed as to not get stuck going back down the same path. Thanks for reading my long rant / post"",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Why does anxiety cause loss of appetite & how to get it back?,UID3845,""Every time I get bad anxiety I completely lose my appetite. Just the smell or thought of food makes me feel sick. But after a while, my body starts to tell me it wants food, even though I can't bring myself to eat it. The hunger pangs begin to feel a lot like the anxiety itself, so I find it makes me worse.

For me this is huge, from a family who have never needed to go to hospital, no broken bones, no diseases, barely a visit to the dr (apart from my depression) to all of a sudden my mum is terminal. UID2349 every ache, every twitch, every spot or bump is something that (in my mind) is going to kill me.

"Worry, worry worry,UID799,""I've often said in these forums """"worry is non productive"""". It doesnt produce a thing for your positivity. You can worry that you have an appointment the next day. Then you dont sleep because you are worried you will sleep in or forget your CV documents or not be dressed up well enough. All 3 things in this example is worry for zero benefit. You can have 2 alarm clocks to prevent you sleeping in, you can place your CV in the car so you dont forget it and you can select your clothing the night before....so off you go and have a good night sleep...bet you dont!! That's because 'worry' is inground, it's part of you, like a limb. So it's extremely difficult to rid yourself of this burden. The first and most important step is separating reality with unrealistic thoughts. When we allow out thought patterns to trod along without challenge then we have a problem. Discipline to attack unrealistic thoughts has to be there for many reasons like - the less you think unrealistically the more time you have for real thoughts. And unrealistic thoughts can cause other issues to- Fear! In 1987 I had a big dispute at my workplace. A pain in my chest and an abnormal heart beat led to a diagnosis of heart attack. This was incorrect and after a few months it was found to be a panic attack. My therapist asked me weekly what happened during the week and I'd tell him I thought my boss would knock on my door, or my doctor wouldnt believe my fear was real or I really did have a heart attack and they got the diagnosis wrong again. Can you the reader see where I'm coming from? The next step is relaxation. Learn it. Go to relaxation classes. Learn muscle tensioning exercises. They really work. What you would be doing is learning a task that some do naturally but for some reason you missed out. It isnt your fault but if you dont attack the issue it will be your fault. You wont find a relaxing life and that is not good. Take it from someone who knows. The last step is prioritising. Placing things in priority allows you to tackle the hard things first then as you tackle less important things you begin to relax more. Finances is a good example. Low on funds you should be shopping for food instead you decide to get that truck load of manure for the garden. For the rest of the week until pay day you struggle with coins only in your pocket. = worry. Worry is non productive.It doesnt produce a thing except hurt, anxiety, depression or at least assists these things. Remove it from your life.

"Having conversations,UID1500,""I've worked out over the years that im generally a quiet person and very internal with my thoughts and feelings. I dont know whether it's my nature or social anxiety (which I do have). I really struggle at times when I don't know what to say. I feel like people find me awkward and avoid having to talk to me. When I get to know someone well, I open up a lot more. Even in my job, I've become known as the quiet one. I'll happily be apart of the conversations, giggle and laugh and use non verbal communication to agree/disagree but I barely speak unless I really have to. My colleagues make comments about it and I feel humiliated at times. Sometimes I have things I want to say but get too anxious to speak up. Other times I don't have anything to say and im happy to just listen and be involved without saying a word. Is this something to accept as being who I am? Or is there a way to get past this? I've worked with a therapist before who gave suggestions on small talk but I sometimes think it's not that, it's just that im quiet in general and literally have nothing to say, preferring to remain out of the focus/attention."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Avoidance,UID3793,""Hi, So I've been trying to work out why I struggle with work and I think one of the issues is avoidance.

I know it isn't a bad thing, I know that it helps with confidence and keeping active with the community, but I find myself trying to avoid it and I realise I do this a lot as well. I also find it hard when I feel backed into a corner like there's no other choice (which is how I feel with this situation) and I guess I just feel agitated. Has anyone gotten help with avoidance and has it helped? I am going to see a counsellor soon and think this will help. Just feeling a bit anxious at the moment..

I've missed my workplace and the clients I work with. I was excited until UID1997 where I had a UID863ting with my boss. My boss has told me I'll be returning to a different role. At first I was flattered that they want me to do this role. But once it sunk in, I started to panic. Im so upset that I can't do what I was doing previously. The role is similar but I'll be moved from my office (and the colleagues I know) to working on my own, from a hot desk in a busy office. The role involves lots of approaching people... Something that I don't feel comfortable doing at all with my social anxiety. I've been feeling anxious enough about returning to work, and now this on top has caused me to completely panic. I rarely slept last night and feel so sick today. I could talk to my boss but what can I say? That I have Anxiety about this new role? That I want my old role back but know this is being filled by someone else already? I'd look weak and really being socially anxious is not something I see them accepting. I'm at the point where I want to quit, which is extreme. We cannot afford for me to quit. I do like employer and I want to work . I just don't want the new role they propose. I also don't want to be anxious all the time, that will then affect my husband and children.

I have found some work for the time being, but I am concerned about telling my folks as they get very agressive when I make a choice like that, it's always wrong.

"Separation anxiety,UID3793,""Hello, Thanks for reading my post. I'm finding my anxiety is increasing at the moment and I'm looking at ways to manage it. I've had it for years and I'm not surprised that it has resurfaced. So, my parents are away at the moment. We have a co-dependant relationship and I normally call my parents at least once a day. I have improved and can have days where I manage fine without them, however, they are away for a month and I am having to cope on my own with no one to turn to, which is why I'm writing this post. I guess the thing that I'm finding hardest is that my mum worries about everything going wrong and we all try to compensate for that. I've been trying to make sure everything is perfect eg having no anxiety, not getting emotional and not having any problems with work and I am struggling. I guess I'm most afraid that she'll come back and be angry at me for one thing or another. I cant please her. I also feel like I can't call them which is hardest. I'm also still adjusting to a relatively new job so any advice on that would be great. I expect to learn things straight away and I feel like my boss expects that too which is extra pressure.

We as sufferers should try to visualize what others see with the effects of our illness. We might be suffering but so are others in that they are trying to work us out or walk away due to the effort needed. 1. Declining invites but you might want to go The debilitating feeling of the date approaching, so overwhelming you cancel it 2. Obsessing over trivial things An unintended word or a glance can upset your UID3984. Others would be confused that you are noticing such minute distractions 3. Go to bed late, wake up early There is a cycle. Wake up early tired, over thinking things and mental exhaustion sends you back to bed. 4.

You can tell when my anxiety is getting high as I seem to post stuff in all the Social places, being light-hearted when I am not!I am too anxious to post in Anxiety you see - how's that for craziness? I wonder what you will think of me? I wonder if the post will remain unanswered - I became afraid that it will remain unanswered, then I will feel worse! I get paranoid and over-think what I will write - what if it's not OK. not good enough? What if it sounds crazy, too crazy to answer or even take seriously.The excessive heat here is getting me down..seriously down. It's affecting my morale something dramatic - I just can't bear it any longer. There is no relief. It's not just physical discomfort - it's like being slowly tortured - being in a hot oven prison I can't escape from. things we love are dying..plants, animals, birds...our very life-force and energy. It's like dying of thirst in a desert. It makes me ill. No one understands.I have things and people who are beautiful. They are beautiful enough to make me """"happy"""". You know what I usually feel when I see how lucky I am to have them - my gorgeous grand children, my family, my friends? I feel sad and scared. Scared that something will happen to them. Or they will stop liking me.The children are so innocent - pain awaits them as they grow older. I cannot prevent pain and bad things happening to them these innocent babies.The more beautiful things and people are in my life...the greater the pain of losing them.

WORRY/ANXIETY/PANIC,UID885,So I have gotten myself in a bit of a state. I have intense feelings that something BAAAD has happened. All because of the fact I sent my father a message asking what days he is working this week and he has 'seen' it but not replied. Usually he is pretty quick to respond or sometimes he forgets to push send but I am adamant something has happened to one of my family members which is why he is choosing not to respond to me yet. I saw on a Police News post UID1997 about a car crash happening and I am scared it may have been my brother. Of course there are many other people living in this UID2254ty but I am so worried that it is him. I can't ask anyone in case its just nothing and I am overreacting for no reason. I have been sobbing and now don't know what to do. Does anyone else assume the worst thing has happened and how do you deal with itUID725 Is there anything to help this like should I mention to my psychiatrist or psychologist when I see them next?,anxiety;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Any help would be appreciated ,UID73,Hi all i am 8 months without meds and have gotten over the withdrawals with a whole lot of hard work and effort. but now I am feeling like I am just living to cope... not getting any better just putting out spotfires everywhere by listening to anti anxiety talk downs meditating Reiki yoga etc etc. can anyone please point me in a direction of something that is going to enable me to live not just exist in between attacks. open to any techniques practitioners anything just not more medication- thanks,anxiety;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Causing mega-anxiety for me - but trivial to others!,UID453,""For many years I have had the use of a work computer here at home - for my personal needs as well as work. It is the only type, program etc that I am familiar with. Continuing to work for this particular boss is becoming more and more impossible and the cause of major stress, anxiety and even illness. (I have talked about this in detail on High Functioning UID73 People) the only thing standing in the way of my """"freedom"""" is my having to get my own laptop as he will immediately remove the computer.

I have no idea what Step 1 is when I get it home. Nothing - the only ones I can afford all have Windows. I don't know how to use Windows. I asked a few Computer Businesses who advertise that they come to the home and help """"mature aged"""" people like me set up and get online.

"OCD scary thoughts and anxiety - need help!,UID73,""Hi to those reading this post. This is my first post on this website as I feel like I have hit boiling point with my symptoms. I'm in my mid 20's and have been dealing with on and off UID4110 behaviour, obsessive scary thoughts, anxiety and depression since I was in my early teens. To be honest, until today, I had no idea what I was dealing with as I thought I was 'going crazy' and turning into a 'psycho'.. or so I kept saying to my boyfriend. I have been having disturbing thoughts about harming myself and the ones I love since I was a kid and would obsess over these thoughts to the point that I would get physically sick (diarrhoea, nausea etc), hot flushes, heart palpitations etc. I always felt like there was a black cloud hanging over me and I would just feel horrible and guilty for having these horrible thoughts. This would last for weeks on end and then I would be okay for a while and something would trigger these thoughts again... usually scary movies or disturbing stories about people hurting themselves or others. I know I am a good person and have a big conscience and could never hurt myself or others but I would obsess over the fact that these thoughts would even come up in my mind. For example, my dad died from a blood clot to the heart a few years ago and through all the horrible grief and emotions, an obsessive thought came up where I thought """"OMG what if I did something that led to his death"""". like as if I made his tea with bad milk or something that could have hurt him. This thought scared me so much that I couldn't be alone for ages and needed my friends and family to be around me all the time to distract me.. I know that he died from natural causes but I had this horrible guilt and anxiety from one silly thought! Today, I told my boyfriend all about these horrible thoughts and anxious UID4110 behaviours I have dealt with in cycles since I was a kid and that's when I made the diagnosis..thanks google! I even will move objects or fix things because I think bad things will happen if I dont. I just want to know that I am not alone and suggestions on how I can get through this and overcome it. These horrible thoughts were somehow triggered last week and have been plaguing me all week to the point where I am too scared to be alone with my own thoughts, or not be completely distracted with activities. Any help or guidance from fellow members would mean the world to me. Thank you if you are still reading this massive post. I appreciate it so much."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For years I've suffered numbness in my face and hands doc has always said stress and anxiety caused and I've been happy to agree. Last 4 months things have gotten much worse pins and needles all down my arms waking me at night my legs do the same pins and needles for hours during the day hard to walk. Or my feet feel like in bucket of ice even with socks and slippers or they can be hot and UID17ollen am exhausted and there is a list of other things happening I went to gp when was having bad day she did some tests reduced sensation and reflex and weakness she sent me to nuro when sore nuro was good day symptom free she did number of test everything normal so she said it's stress causing the problem cronic fatigue or fibromyalgia I should take a holiday. Not sure what to do I understand stress does strange things to your body and I'm happy to accept that I'm just struggling to understand how I would have reduced sensation and reflexes. Also heat makes it worse hot day or hot shower. But I understand if was medical wouldn't be ok on good days. It's just my stress management has been better so why this happening?

I had to go to Centrelink some years ago when I was very ill, physically as well as mentally......and they want us to work as many hours as possible, so I have been doing that and reporting earnings etc of course - all above board. They have no problem with my giving up work entirely if I have to, thank God, so I am not worried about hassles with them. It is """"letting down"""" the boss. I can't do it any more. I can't put on this front any more of being so capable, so professional, so reliable. I don't enjoy one single minute of my job any more. I feel guilty about even posting this - instead of putting my mind, my jumbled overloaded stressed out mind to doing the work required of me.

"Anxiety?...plan your future.,UID799,""Who would have known? That when first hit with panic attacks, the shakes and racing thoughts- that it would be nearly a generation before most of those symptoms were overcome. We read here a constant stream of anxiety sufferers that some are looking for a quick fix. A common theme it seems with anxiety is that we have strong tendencies to think only day to day as we are tied up with coping with our illness so much so we don't think about future plans in tackling the problem. When we are anxious we are less likely to be good money savers, involve our thoughts with family planning or long term studies, its like our endurance is non existent. How then can we tackle anxiety that requires treatment and mental exercises like relaxation classes as well as home exercises when we don't have that drive long term? The mix is important. Medication, therapy, changes in lifestyle and removing toxic people, job UID17ap and a slower calmer living location. But also routine. My therapist in 1987 taught me muscle tensioning exercises. Nearly 30 years later I'm still doing them and throughout that time I've done them prior to sleep...in bed. My anxiety was such that doing them during the day I felt like I was wasting time when I could do other things more important. Such was my thinking...yet those exercises were much more a priority! 20 minutes doing mte's meant I slept better too. I put in place my move to the country. That took a few years with occupation change and land purchase. To keep the mind on par with my plans I regularly visited my block to clear the trees and imagine my home built. Such medium and long range plans and dreams fell into place as time went on. I was able to stop medication in 1999, 12 years after diagnosis and in 2012 I felt I was free of nearly all symptoms. However I still have anxious times that I put down to life itself but remain aware of anxiety returning. We can't ever fully drop our guard with anxiety, as we can't with depression. That's why we need to seek out lifestyle changes and take the view that this illness is serious and won't go away in the short term. To sum up Work closely with your GP Undertake recommended classes and therapy Make positive changes to lifestyle and be decisive with relationships Make medium and long range plans Be positive and accept there is unlikely any quick fix Self discipline, breathing and relaxation exercises must be done. Be kind to yourself. Not too many expectations...  "",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Anxiety or Depression? Or can you have both?,UID453,""I just did the Mind Spot quiz for depression and came up moderately severe. My main hurdle is anxiety, at times blitzing into panic attacks, resulting in insomnia, worry, obsessive thinking, occasional paranoid thoughts e.g. neighbours are watching me, talking about me - going overboard in trying to please people so they won't hurt, dislike or abandon me......over the past 2 months I had a sort of double-whammy in losing two prominent, long-standing and very precious people in my life - one a friend, the other a romantic interest/love partner......a couple of weeks apart. I hadn't begun to work my way through the first, when UID2087ivered the second blow! some years back I had a similar condition to deal with (I couldn't deal with it though - it left me damaged and scarred)...when about 4 major stressors occurred in the space of a few years.....you know that list of Top 10 things - Major Life Losses.....well I had about 4 of those...no time to recover from one, when another one happened! It resulted in mild agoraphobia from fear of """"what will happen to me next?"""" much safer to stay at home. I had no time to heal, no time to rest, no treatment - I had two children and a job which became the next thing to lose....then I became a """"job seeker"""" on Centrelink. No one helped me. At least now its only been 2 losses, but I'm getting lower and lower - sort of a combination of my usual anxiety, mixed with a deep sadness and sense of great loss . I wait for the day to pass until it's dark and I feel sort of """"safer""""like nothing else bad can happen - the day is nearly over. I am frightened I will become that messed up woman I was years ago when the list of stressors/losses happened one after another. I relied on alcohol - now I'm not allowed to drink for health reasons, so no soothing glass of wine for me. GP won't prescribe meds.....only something for sleep which I have to ration myself so as not to give the impression I am abusing them. How can I cope better this time around and not end up the UID1238 human being I was back then?. At least this time its only 2 major blows - I feel crying is a good release for me....but what if someone drops in and sees me?

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and UID4110 a few months ago, and also moderate depression. My friends and family have been great, but I feel like they don't understand. My father has UID4110, but he was never treated, so he doesn't understand what its like to constantly have to see a therapist and go through taking medication. My siblings are too young to understand and my mother, although she's been greatly supportive and understanding, doesn't realise what it's like . She doesn't understand why I get so frightened of raised voices, or why I'm so stupidly sensitive and why I spend time doing things to deal with my UID4110.

"Saying no (social anxiety),UID3793,""Hi all, I have a bit of a problem with family outings. I understand that when you make plans, sometimes things change and for those with anxiety this can be a reason for it as well. I'm finding that one of the reasons for my social anxiety is that I need to feel that I can change my mind or say no, yet with my family I feel like I've got no choice. One person in the family tries to control this and if I cancel for any reason I get 'if you keep cancelling no one will want to spend any time with you'. I don't do it on purpose, just sometimes I feel a sense of relief when I can say I change my mind or say I'll think about it. I did have a relationship where I broke up with someone and things went downhill after that and the controlling person said I should have checked with them first before making that decision.

"Excitement, adrenalin, anxiety, fear who mixes them up?,UID799,""style=""""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt";"> As a boy I had a family that was always 'nervous'. We used that word to cover most feelings of tension or anything really that involved something that took us away from the rare (for us) feeling of being relaxed. In fact I was never relaxed, I was “bored”. As I grew older in my twenties I used to describe myself to others as a nervous character. That word nervous never left my self description until I was in my 40’s. I’m now 60yo. In the last 15 years I’ve realised I needed to divide up my nervous world into categories of the other feelings- to correct the error of everything being under the nervous umbrella. Buying a new car in my twenties and I’d mistake my excitement for nerves. You get the picture. This is likely the programming from my family. So I’m wondering how many people out there, members like you, have described anxiety for something else? I’m wondering, if some of us are labelling anxiety when it could be worry or excess concern or excitement maybe but if it isn’t anxiety then what could it be?. Mental health professionals of course are the ones for a correct diagnosis. I’m concerned here for the readers that haven’t had a diagnosis and are curious. Or those that have had diagnosis and if they think its anxiety and some of it isnt so, it might be worth conveying this to your therapist. Could you be feeling something other than bad nerves or anxiety. For me there is only a fine line between all of these feelings but that just could be me and my upbringing. Can you separate them? Do you get them mixed up? Or is there a definite line between all of these feelings in your opinion?  "",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I've been doing my breathing exercises and trying to just keep moving forward with my plans. But the more real it becomes, the more my anxiety comes back. I've noticed that I've start twitching again and I'm nervously tapping my toes non-stop. I'm scared of that racing heart feeling and off freaking out on the plane. I'm scared that once the plane has taken off, thats it, I can't stop it. Part of me is excited to see my mum and go on holiday. The other part of me is terrified and just wants to cancel the whole thing and hide. My GP has prescribed me something to calm me. I've never had it before and so I need to try it before I fly to know how it will effect me. My boyfriend will be with me and I know I need to take plenty of things to occupy myself. I know I need to do this. I know I have to go. I know that once I get there I will be glad I went and I know that I will regret it forever if I don't go. What I don't know is how I'm going to do it. Any insights from those who have managed to travel long distances with anxiety would be greatly appreciated."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sometimes I'll be reading and read the sentence wrong, or be reading and have to read it again cause I didn't understand what it said. I also have sort of light headed, dizzy spells. Today for example I am tired, and I feel like I'm not reading well and I have a tense feeling in my head. These symptoms appear when I'm tired and then they make me anxious and so the symptoms get worse.

(Eg: last night I obbsessed over weather I had scizophrenia so much, listened for sounds, got no sleep, then in the morning laying with my son in the early hours, thought I heard someone (male) speak to me, when I fully woke up all I could hears was my son snoring in the same tone, dream? Anxiety is what the BB line said. - feeling a bit like anti social. -so bloody tired - when I walked past a girl at work UID1997 I said bye and in my head I'm like , you awful person, but I don't even dislike her (at one stage I wasnt a fan)!

"Nothing stays the same ,UID2131,""It's strange. I was dreading the Christmas period. But a few days before Christmas I found myself feeling well for much of the time. And apart from a few hours here and there I've had a good time. Strange though. It felt like a ceasefire rather than anything else. And I'm very glad I had it. But now I'm back to where I was. Scared. Fear of the future robs you of the day. But I'm not able to live in the day. Whatever the fear it's the intensity that cripples. That awful fear that your life is wrecked. That somehow you will ruin everyone else's life. I'm living with it. And it's amazing how days pass by. And the ways I try to put it in perspective. Looking at all the centuries and thinking of all the people who have got by. If I say please don't tell me it'll be fine don't take offence. It feels like a mockery. I really hope that doesn't offend anyone because on here I UID863t the nicest people. It's just that at the beginning of Dec. it all got worse and in a way I need people to let me be where I am.

"Do I Have Purpose?,UID3845,""One of the things I find that I get anxious about is feeling like I have a purpose, like there is a point to my existence.

I feel like I'm getting older and like I've missed a vital step in life. Like there is something I am meant to be doing and I'm not doing it. Days often feel like I'm just waiting for another day to be over. I don't feel like I'm doing much, I just go to work, come home, watch tv, repeat. And then on weekends try and find something to do to fill the days. I've been looking up UID863tup groups and clubs or groups I could try and join, but it all feels kind of weird and pretend.

"Struggling so much ,UID2131,""Life is not good. Three weeks ago my anxiety worsened. I'd been having five or more good days between a bout of about a week. About six weeks ago I had to go for a scan for a post menopausal bleed. Uncertainty is a MASSIVE problem for me. My fear was that the stress would make me severely UID1238 again. I wasn't worried about my physical health. I know that doesn't make sense. I was so scared that I ended up going private even though the Dr said it would be only three weeks wait. Since then, apart from a handful of days three weeks ago things have been very bad. I get the odd afternoon or evening when my UID3984 is OK. Normally when I'm unwell my UID3984 never becomes worse. Most of this is fear. Fear of my mental illness. I think as time goes on I'm more afraid. I carry on and I'm very lucky that I'm able to continue my routine. I don't think Christmas is making me worse though I'll be glad when it's over. If I don't reply to any post for a while it's because computers stress me a lot. I said the other week (though most unclearly) that I wish I was an old lady. Then I would only have a short while left. . I hope you know what I mean. Life is very hard just now.

"I think I am suffering anxiety,UID327,""I am a middle aged male in a happy home environment. My youngest daughter last year experienced an event related to vomiting (a gear of) that led to her rapidly losing weight and displaying a range of really weird behaviours ranging from scratching her skin to saying she just wanted to die. This culminated in her being admitted to hospital to be refed via a naso gastric tube. Since then she has gained weight but there are still a whole range of anxious behaviours continuing. At the start of the school year she has made it very difficult for us to get her to school. She says she likes the school but comes up with many reasons why she can't go. This revolves around her stomach and the sick feelings she gets. We have been seeing a group therapy team since she left hospital which has been helpful but there still seems to be so much unresolved business. This experience has left me feeling very distressed and unsure what the future will bring. I work a high pressure job but I am now constantly worried about what the future looks like because I can't see past the problems we are currently experiencing. I feel I cannot be an effective father because I get unreasonable angry when my daughter won't conform to what I see as a normal behaviour such as getting up and going to school. I know we have to deal with this but in the meantime I feel like my usually strong character is dissolving me into an anxious person.

"Feeling Pointless,UID3845,""I never know whether to post in anxiety or depression. I think this an anxiety thing? I woke up as usual feeling anxious this morning, but managed to calm myself and got a bit more sleep. Which I was pretty proud of. But, once I did get up I just felt that tension in my chest and I was anxious again. I went into the living room and lay on the couch and turned on the tv to try and take my mind off it. But I don't want to just sleep all the time. I know if I sleep now I wont be able to sleep later. So now, Im sitting here in my lounge, watching kids shows, wondering what to do? And trying to think of something made me feel kind of pointless. I don't have kids like my friends, I don't really have any hobbies or anything. I walked into my partners office and said """"what do I do now?"""" and he said """"you can do whatever you like"""". But I seriously can't think of a single thing to do. Its hot out today and the heat makes me feel worse, so I don't really fancy going for a walk. Going to the shops seems like a waste. There is nothing I need or want. I don't think I could concentrate on a movie. Its too hot to garden.

"Fear I will really become paranoid! ,UID2187,""Hi guys, I'm having a really great day today, which is super, but I wanted to ask you guys a question. As you know my latest fear, health wise, is scizophrenia. UID2349 previous to my deal with my GP, psyciatrist and psycologist not to google health issues I had, I googled a lot, over and over. Truth be known I still cave and do it. (My doctor says I get no gold stars, when I see her weekly, if I've googled, lol). When I googled scizophrenia, I read a lot of personal accounts and also did lots of those quizzes, """"do you have the early signs of scizophrenia"""". Mostly I would score I didnt, once or twice I scored I might. Anyway, gettin off track, one of the symptoms I read about was paranoia, specifically the thought """"they"""" or specific groups were watching them! I started to think about that a lot, as I do, the obsessive thinking coming out ! Then I would wonder what if someone put a tracker in my ring or lamp, ok, I have an active imagination! UID2349 all along I knew it was just a paranoid thought, and attributed it to the stuff I'd read, as I'd done in the past with ms symptoms. Ocassionally the thoughts still pop into my head, what if..... Do I really believe this.... My question is, after this long winded explanation, is, can you think about something so much, get so anxious about the thought, that you actually start to beleive it, in essence make yourself UID2087usional/paranoid?

I assume that the fidgeting and shakes along with the tense, feeling I get in the morning are my anxiety. Same with the heart palpitations. And I assume that the crying, lethargy, loss of appetite and lack of self care are the depression? But I wonder about the intrusive thoughts. Is that anxiety?

"Lost in the Past - Relapse,UID1015,""Hi guys, I'm new to this forum, but I'm not new to this -go-round of anxiety, So I feel a little silly writing this right now. A good start to this story is that I have overcome this thing twice and been able to manage for a good 1.5 years currently. However I am slipping again. My anxiety is not about the future, I'm pretty good at UID863ting that head on. My anxiety is about the past, which makes it so difficult to overcome because it's always there. I get anxiety about things in the past that I might have done but not thought about, or not thought what people would think. I get anxiety looking back at things like driving home, once I'm home, I worry about whether I ran red lights or cut people off. By this time my mind has usually distorted things and I can remember exactly what could have happened. Lots of small things like this and they can just ruin my memories and send me into panic. Lately I have been less able to put these things back in the past. People keep telling me the last won't hurt me and I just have to move on but we all know how that feels. Sounds easy right? I have been getting worse and worse over the last few weeks and now here I am unable to function almost. Yesterday was a crazy storm event. I work on an island so as soon as we heard things were going to get bad we were out the door to get home. The road can sometimes flood. Anyways we got to this road area and it was water over the road. I can't even remember how much!!. But everyone was still going through. Big cars small cars etc so I went through. Scared stiff but I followed the line of people, took my turn and slowly and carefully followed the line of cars . My work colleagues were one in front and one behind and we all went through ok, followed by many many more people on either side of be road. I'm not sure if they ever closed that road at all. Nothing happened, we were all through safe, I breathed a sigh of relief. However I could not stop shaking hVe been in panic mode since then. I know it was a stupid and horrible thing to do, I know how dangerous it was but I followed everyone. However I am stuck having flashbacks and anxiety. I don't know if this was just the last straw and my anxiety is back full time but I know I sure do not feel good today. I could not sleep. thats my mind right now. I was wondering does anyone else get anxiety about the past? can get rid of anxiety for the 3rd time without medication? I hate being back here in my head."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Family events and social anxiety,UID3793,""Hi all, I have a bit of an issue with my relationship with my mum. I always thought we were close and often spoke with each other, but lately I feel like there is a bit of emotional guilt from my mum. If there is a family event, such as a birthday or anniversary, and I cant make it due to social anxiety or my health my mum gets very angry with me. She wont always show it around other people, but does when she's just talking with me, so I have no proof to back it up. Then if I don't make it, like I have recently, she gives me the silent treatment and she has admitted that she does this when she's angry. I then start to feel guilty and feel like I have to make it up to her even though it wasn't her birthday and it had nothing to do with her, but it's like I've caused a great injustice. One time when I couldn't make it she didn't speak to me for three weeks, I was shattered.

"FEAR - any advice please?,UID2131,""For many years I have been dealing with depression and anxiety. The first bout 13 years ago was traumatic. For the third time in 6 months an overwhelming fear of going back there has come to me, despite my depression being very mild. This time it's much worse owing to a return of a particular symptom. I am having major problems with my sleep. Not sleeping I can cope with but I'm having highly distressing symptoms of anxiety - palpitations and a lurching of my stomach (really horrible) as I'm dropping off, and so waking me up. Eventually, back then, I found I didn't want to sleep because of the symptoms. The high alert my mind is on stops sleeping tablets working.I have been working on my breathing. I keep reminding myself that I was very ill then and although this is happening it is only one part of that episode. My fear seems to override these things. All those years ago the problem went as soon as I began to respond to anti depressants. So I have to live with this. Two very good friends assure me that the fear that sneaked in for no reason will go again as I continue to get on with my life, which I can manage even with very poor sleep. I don't think I've levelled out with my sleeping problem yet and I wonder if that is making my fear worse.I go to see my gp on Tues. This is 99% association is it not? In Scotland it's dark and wet. It was the same time then that these symptoms were worst. I wonder if it would be just as bad if it were Summer. Perhaps everyone has their own demons in their illness and I guess we're all different. This is one of mine.

"Fear of disappointing your partner or not loving them enough,UID11,""Hello all, I have had very mild anxiety through out my childhood (most of which I recently learnt I had repressed) but recently my anxiety has flared up enormously regarding my relationship. My partner and I have been together for almost two years. We're from different countries and made the decision to get engaged so that we could marry here and he could get a visa. We were living in his country preparing to come out here and now I am here (due to a family commitment) and we have been long distance for 2 months) and Up until 3 months ago I felt fine with it all and completely happy and excited. Then one morning I woke up with an intense pressure on my chest and stomach and my head was UID17imming with fearful thoughts surrounding my relationship. Never to do with him or anything he might do, it is always me in these fears. I have flashes of what if I don't love him anymore or do I love him enough or do I want all this with him. These fears just refuse to let go and get so strong that I start believing they're real. I lose the ability to tell myself what it is that I want. I have no idea of what's real and what is just a fear. Has anyone felt this too? It's never a fear of him, it's always of me. Me disappointing or hurting him or not loving him. I have had two sessions with a psychologist and more coming up, but with him it's such a slow process while he paints a picture of the situation in order to help me deal with it.

"my thoughts ,UID885,""Too many rambling thoughts, as per usual. Sorry if it doesn't make sense :S I find it weird that everyone is different and forced to find a way to live and cope in this world. Many different beliefs, values,morals, cultures, careers and experiences. Communication with other people, whether it be strangers to me or family is a daily struggle. It's something we all have to do yet it feels unnatural and weird to me. People talk all the time and I don't know how they do it. Many times I can't find the voice to talk let alone come up with something to say. Going out in public, see people going about their day. How do they work out their next move or what to do next? How do they have such long conversations with people and it not bother them? Day after day. I try to do my homework from the psychologist. Have a small conversation with the cashier at the supermarket. Even a 'hello how are you' will do. I get up to the register and nervously look at all the people around and instantly feel overwhelmed. I squeak out a 'hello' and that's that. I go to the car and burst into tears. I have failed yet again.I've only ever had one job. Which ended with me having a breakdown and quitting. Although leading up to it I was often feeling overwhelmed at work so much i just couldn't do it. All I want is to work for my money, enjoy what I do and live in my own place. I hate feeling like a burden to my family and best friend. I wish I I could be a better person for them. I feel isolated and alone. Stuck. UID3730 where I'll be living next year yet.

Anxiety returned after nearly a month of relief :(,UID3880,Hello everyone. Ive written on these forums before. Ive been diagnosed with BPD and Dysthymia and recently went to an emergency refuge clinic while my parents looked after my daughter. I was doing so well while I was there for a week then when I came out I felt fresh with a different outlook on life and also was looking forward to my grandma coming over to stay for 3 weeks with me. Shes from Darwin so means a lot that shes here. Anyways its getting near the end of her stay. She leaves in 2 days and I don't know if its subconscious but today I have had extremely bad anxiety and have felt neuseas and judt wana cry. It must be because I know im going to be completely on my own looking after my daughter. Shes not a hard child to look after but everything is hard when I feel like this. I haven't had to come on this forum for a while because ive been doing so well but now im scared im going to fall into a heap after she leaves. I just want to hide and cry :'(,anxiety;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, with the HSC now done there is little to no work for casual teachers for the rest of 2014. I've tried to save as much as I can over the last year to have enough to get by over this period but due to one big even in my life I wasn't able to save as much as I would have liked.

If I went down and she referred to me to a psychiatrist they would assess that and decide. If she was to ask advice on meds it would be unlikely they would be altered. Usually it's only anti psychotics that are changed. In other words you have to be down there before you get help. The good thing is she has referred me for a mindulness course although it's likely to be next 6 moths any way before that happens.

"can anyone tell me what's going on?,UID2131,""I've not been on the forums for a week or two. I'm having new symptoms that don't make sense. By the beginning of June I was coming out of a 5 month depression - it was mild for me. Then one day I developed horrendous fear (mental rather than physica ) that I'd go right down again. After an awful week it passed and I started back up. Within 4 weeks I was fine again then wham- the same horrible fear Which passed after a week. I went on to have 3 pretty good weeks - then fear again though not just as intense but debilitating. This went after a couple of days. So I begin to relax - then last Friday -just four days later here it is again - very like the one before in duration and intensity. My GP thinks it's unpleasant but has no answers. In 12 years of depression I've haven't had fear anything like this bad. My depression and anxiety are minimal - I don't know what's going on. Just now(ie in the last few days) the only thing that's holding me back is the belief that this will return. Because it's so new to me I am unable to see how it can possibly resolve. Can it? Please if any of the answers are UID4516tive don't tell me. Also I can't see a psychiatrist as they'd recommend CBT which I've done lots of. I feel totally lost in all this and whilst I'm grateful for the good days the fear is blighting my life.

"Seeking the origin of anxiety ,UID799,""It is reasonable to think that finding the origin of why something happens is the first step in a cure. I'm not suggesting a cure for anxiety but yes towards the first step in terms of understanding it. A lifetime (I'm 58yo) of anxiety largely reducing in the last 5 years. Along with depression, dysthymia and bipolar 2. So after 10 months being retired on medical grounds my wife and I set off for a major UID2254ty to shop, a 45 minute journey on a UID1953 road. All was fine, we had good conversation, the weather was good. My wifebrought up a new topic- my colonoscopy for next week. Fine,we chatted. Then she stated a few things """"we better not forget our paperwork"""" and """"we have to get to the hospital by 9am"""". Then another """"You have to fast on Sunday- you'll hate that"""". There was no fault from my wife. But my anxiety shot up through the car roof. I mentioned this to her. And we explored why. See, as I told her, I've had about 90 jobs in my working life. Most jobs there was always someone that would try to put the fear into a new arrival eg """"You havent met the boos yet, when he comes back from leave on Monday you'll realise what you are in for"""" or """"Wait till we get a big shipment, then you'll know what work is all about"""". On every occasion that fearmongering presented itself I personally got through it with flying colours. So why the anxiety? My childhood seemed normal but it wasnt. My father I rarely saw as he'd work 12 hours days. My stay at home mum was affectionate but erratic. I'm estranged from her now and have been for 4 years and I believe she has BPD. Her UID3984 was never predictable and I was always in fear of her screaming at me without notice even for minor things. Then after upset I'd get a hug and often an apology from her. The two extremes were never met with the middle ground it was either affection or screaming. for the first time in my life I have directly associated my anxiety to a source. UID2349 my wife and I can direct our conversations and my thoughts AWAY from what if topics or any topics that could grow fear. And if we do stumble upon such topics we can overcome fear by cutting it off early eg """"that's ok, we'll get through it. We've planned everything so that will be ok"""" Effective reassurance....easing back out of the fear trap. My anxiety largely has reduced over the last few years due to retirement, financial plans and lifestyle. Also family decisions like ridding my life of UID4516tive people with expectations. Today I took another leap forward."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I don't know where I am,UID2131,A couple of weeks ago I went into a terrible fear - that I'd go right down again. My depressions have been very mild for a long time but the fear was awful. Then on the Sunday it cleared. So I did loads that week. But on Saturday (just gone) anxiety started kicking in. All I can think is that my UID3984 will go down - perhaps not to the bottom but badly. My sleeps rubbish - it was just getting right again. I feel trapped. People who know me tell me this will lift. I can't believe it. It's so scary. My GP saw me recently and tells me my fear is something that might come and go. He is satisfied re my meds. And here is a worry. I have recently been changed to the generic drug from the original. I've been told that doesn't make any difference but on the internet some reports say it can. I am carrying on with my routine. But I just want to cry and I'm hyper sensitive.

I guess thats kids for ya. She would be home with me today anyway as she doesnt o to childcare on thurs. Even if its not an infection think ill leave her home 2moro then she will be 100% when she goes back on monday. Dont wont her to get worse or recatch another bug. I know this is all prob very boring to a lot of you but just thought id have a bit of a chat to see what everyone is up to so i can get my mind off my anxiety.

"Not really knowing where to start! Im new to this board as well.,UID3880,""Hello my name is Chloe and im 29 years old with 2 children. One girl who i have full custody of and the father isn't involved and a son who spends most of his time with his dad. I have been diagnosed with anxiety/depression since my late teens and been on and off various anti depressants for years. i have had a few bad times in my past but nothing compared to what i have been going through recently. Around 6 monthes ago i decided to come off my antidepressant which up until then was working very well for me, i just started to get some more bad days then good so my doctor decided to put me on a different drug so i tried another antidepressant but that didnt work either so we then started another and slowly increased the dose. I now wish i never went off my first antidepressant until recently with all the drug changes a started to feel unwell physically and emotionally. One day i was fine and the next i woke up like i had a really bad hangover but without the fun of drinkin the night before. I wasa mess that day and was hopin it was a one day thing and would go away the next day. Unfortunetly it didnt and every day got worse that i had seen doctors many times and even went to the emerency clinic as i couldnt stop shaking, was neausus and vomiting and had really bad restless legs. I have had restless legs in the past but nothin like this. It got to a point where i was crying 24/7 and even the most simplist thing like dressing/bathing/feeding and looking after my daughter was a struggle. This went on for a week when i had enough and couldnt cope. Previously the drugs didnt even work on me i was that anxious. Finally i went to the emergency with a referal from my GP and i stayed in hospital a few days as i needed sleep so badly as up until my bad attack started a week earlier i was having broken sleep for 2 or 3 hrs a night and hallucinating. My daughter had to stay with me as no1 could look after her so i couldnt have anything 2 strong to help me sleep. The next few nights my family helped and looked after her so i could get some much needed rest. I felt more positive when i left hospital. I am on an anti-pychotic drug which has helped a lot."",anxiety";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"I sought out help but...,UID3067,""A while ago a friend of mine decided to take me to Headspace to see a shrink as I'm really not sure what it is that's wrong with me but it's become apparent that something is, in fact, wrong. I also had a second friend there to make sure I didn't run away. This was only to make the appointment. In the past I had a terrible experience with quite possibly the worst shrink in Australia. So I was incredibly anxious about seeking help again. After I managed to get through the paperwork to make the appointment my hands were already shaking so the receptionist gave me some information with an email so that I could contact the staff to fee more comfortable about going. I emailed them and received a reply which, upon reading, put my nerves at ease for a while. Never-the-less as my appointment date grows nearer I've become more and more worried to the point where I considered simply not going. However the fact that I had a group of three people accompanying me would make that pretty tricky. My main point is, two out of my three have just bailed and the third isn't sure if she'll make it on the day, meaning I'm free to skip my appointment and no one could stop me. But at the same time, my friend who originally convinced me to go took the time out to try to get me to help myself and even thought it makes me cringe to think about, I feel like I'm obligated to go even I know I couldn't so much as step into the building on my own. I just don't know what to do. So somebody, anybody, please if you have any advice or ideas of what I should do to help the situation it could really help me.

"Learning how to survive lifelong depression,UID11,""Hello again everyone, We hear all the time that speaking up when you're not ok is the key to surviving depression. I think I'm finally understanding how that might look for people like me who keep on experiencing episodes of major depression and suicidal thoughts. When I first asked for help I was desperate. Two babies at home depending on me and clinging on stubbornly. It made sense to force myself to be honest about how I felt. People around me saw improvement. I felt ok for a while. But I also started to feel like people around me needed me to be ok again. Although people care depression wears everyone down. I felt embarrassed to show I'm falling apart again. So I slowly started performing again in public because it feels like my depression hurts everyone around me. It is exhausting pretending you're ok when you're not. Something happened. Hubby and I had a massive fight. He said something fair that made me stop and think. He said I put so much energy into pretending publicly I'm ok and only allow myself to fall apart at home where I feel safe. So he feels like everyone else sees the best of me and my loved ones get the worst. It was an honest point. He's right and I want to give what energy I have to the people I love. After all... They are why I'm still here. So I decided to stop performing. I gave up the hours at work I felt pressured to give. I'm taking a break from volunteering here. I'm posting for myself. Then something else happened. I had a psychiatrist appointment. It set me into a panic. In a bad place I shaved my hair off. It doesn't suit me at all. I feel ugly. I wanted to show on the outside somehow what a mess I feel inside. It definately works. I'm embarrassed to go out. People notice. At work a bloke called me 'butch' and asked me why the hell I cut it. People keep asking me if I'm ok. I knew the psychiatrist would be worried. So I dressed up. Make up. Earrings. Nice girly clothes. Hubby noticed and smiled because he understood what I was doing even if I didn't. The kids asked what I did to my eyes (mascara). I joked I was putting on my armour. I was trying to hide. If I hid I'd go to the doctor and come home without the help I needed... yet again. So instead I told the doctor the truth. About the armour. That I want to be ok but I'm not. Meds don't work. I'm back where I was. He listened. Increased meds. We have a plan for what's next if nothing changes. The lesson?

I have moved back in with my parents and I feel like I am just weighing them down. they are arguing when they think i can't hear them. My Ex has already moved on and everytime I think of her it hurts. anything I try to do to distract myself no longer works, I used to love playing Computer Games, Wood Work and Painting, I never feel like I have the motivation to do it. I don't have the motivation to help myself and it scares me, it scares me how fast I feel like disappearing. I'm scared that suicide feel like a good option. I know it won't help and that it will hurt those I care about. but sometimes it feels like the best thing to do. Any advice or support would be appreciated Cheers, "",suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"The Urge To Self Harm,UID453,""The urge to self harm is always there. Hovering in the back of mind, but at night it’s stronger. It’s like a person is in my head screaming. ‘Just do it‘ ‘All your pain will go away.’ ‘ Your not strong enough to fight it so just get it over with.’ ‘You will feel so much better once it’s done.’ It’s a nightly battle that I endure and a battle I often lose. After 2 years I have just started to open up about my past to my psychologist and all the feelings and emotions and sensations have come to the surface and I am finding it hard to deal with them. All the distractions I started to put into place have gone straight out the window. The thoughts of ending it are always in my head. The feeling of shame, defeat, burden, worthlessness, disgust, dirty, loneliness and I could go on but there are. not enough characters for me to write them all are weighing me down. Just over 2 years ago I was hospitalised and when I got out I some what got my life back on track. I was able to deal with all of this a lot better but now I feel like I have just taken 1000 steps backwards. It’s extremely frustrating and disheartening. I don’t know what to do anymore."",suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Self care and coping strategy tips between psychiatrist visits please,UID417,""Hi. As the title says, I'm just looking for some self care and coping strategy tips please, anything at all - to do in person, online, websites, anything. I understand it's different for everybody but I'd really appreciate some suggestions if anyone has any, anything is fine. I've been looking at stuff on other forums that people have tagged me in and have tried some things but the more ideas, the better. Usually what I do is listen to music (rock and metal), go for my daily walks and try to do some mindfulness with my surroundings, go on the forums, colour in and sometimes do a jigsaw puzzle I've been doing (1000 pieces), that's pretty much all I can think of. My Psychiatrist gave me a couple of ideas, all of which I've tried such as doing a Mindspot course (I personally didn't find it helpful but that's just me, maybe others might), read Beating The Blues (I have it but haven't read it yet since I'm not a big reader), and other things. Any suggestions would be appreciated, thanks very much. Hope this okay to post and in the right thread, otherwise mods, feel free to move it to an appropriate thread.

Broken,UID325,I have no other way to explain how I feel. I can't even begin to find words that would explain the mess inside my head. The thoughts that fill my days. The wishing I could die but can't leave my kids. They need me more than ever right now and I'm nothing but failing them. I can be fine for a few days; maybe... then I'm back to rock bottom. I'm on more meds than I've been in the past and still I'm like this. I self harm because I feel I deserve to suffer for being such a failure and pathetic person. I have few people who care and I know I don't deserve them. I've posted before in here but I lose track for a few days then people don't reply and I feel like I've upset them as well. I think about suicide everyday. The world would be a better place without me in it and even though I stay for my kids - they would probably be better off without me too. I don't expect any replies as I know I don't deserve any but I needed to get how I feel out.,suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Wish I wasn't here. Possible trigger warning.,UID417,""*POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING.* I'm trying to start liking where I live but I just can't, it's just isolated and the people here are so rude, there's honestly barely any nice people, maybe like 3 or so people. We've lived here for 2 years. I like the nature on my walks, bird life and that it's peaceful but that's all. This doesn't help because I feel bad about myself and hate myself inside and out anyway and have enough to deal with especially mentally. I try not to let it get me down but it does. There's nothing at all for me to do here, no studying (can't afford it and don't qualify for free courses), jobs, meeting people, anything. I went to the local Headspace centre and was made fun of for my mental illnesses by staff and group members for no reason. I'm seeing a Psychiatrist on Skype that I'm happy with and he's like a godsend to me because I've never had a professional like that. I have a new GP but I'm still learning to trust her since she hasn't done anything for me yet. I just wish I wasn't here, I have no purpose, I'm a failure. My only friends are overseas in America and one in the UK, I have no friends online or in person hence me joining these forums. No one cares, I'm just a loner, loser, everything bad. I hate myself and just want to harm myself and wish I wasn't here. I've never done anything and these meds are hard for me to deal with plus me going on new meds in a week, and other things. I have Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, Social Anxiety, Anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) and Avoidant Personality Disorder, yes I've been diagnosed with all of those by my Psychiatrist. It's so hard for me to cope every day and not harm myself. I don't do much just go out with my parents, spend too much time on the internet, colour in, listen to music and go for walks, I have no life. Sorry all.

"Anxious to start new meds, *possible trigger warning.*,UID417,""*POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING.* I'll be starting my new meds next week (antidepressants), starting on a low dosage. My Psychiatrist gave me a list of symptoms (although I may not experience them) and said that some people feel like they've been hit by a sledgehammer on these so I may or may not. I'm anxious and scared. He told me that these are like an old medication, they still prescribe them but not as often as other ones such as the ones I've previously been on. My GP has heard of them but didn't seem to have any knowledge of them. The Pharmacist was confused too, luckily the Chemist has the fax from my Psychiatrist for them though. He told me how to deal with the side effects. I told him that my flashbacks from PTSD, anxiety and depression, including my weird dreams and intrusive dark thoughts even of harming myself and plans of doing so have gotten worse and more frequent and my sleep is getting worse (I have insomnia anyway). He told me ways not to harm myself and distract myself (I never did anything) such as the rubber band trick which I've been doing. I don't know how to cope anymore, I'm anxious and scared. I'll probably start crying when I see him again because I have a feeling without jumping to conclusions that these will make me feel awful mentally and physically but I hope they help somehow.

"New user, just have a question please. Please be nice, not sure how to use this.,UID417,""Hi everyone, my name is  & I'm 20. This is my first time using the Beyond Blue Forums, although I've spoken to Beyond Blue through the webchats a lot, especially lately. I just have a question please. I see my Psychiatrist through Telehealth (Skype), & I feel comfortable with him & like I can trust him, in fact he's been the best therapist I've ever had & I've had a few. I've never had any problems with him & he was great the first time I saw him & still is. Anyway, my question is, is it ok to contact him in between sessions if something goes wrong, for example really strong suicidal thoughts, & I can't seek help elsewhere as in a triage (it's hard for me to access proper care in regional ). I have a number to his office on prescriptions he gave me, so if I had to contact him, I'd use that number since I don't have an email for him personally. Is it ok to do this? I'd be worried about annoying him, & being a burden, but I try to tell myself that it's his job & he'd be use to these things, & worse. Plus would he rather support me outside of a session than hear something has happened to me? What would I say if I contact him & how would he support me? I apologise for this question being so random & stupid, I just wanted to get some advice because I'm not sure & I don't want to annoy & bother him. Please be nice, it's my first time on these forums & first post. Please don't judge, I'm quite sensitive. Thanks, please help. PS - I did call the local triage but the guy on the phone didn't mention his name but he was quite rude & unhelpful, which is unfair because I've never contacted a triage place. All I asked is if I could make an appointment or come in (my Psychiatrist said I can walk in like most triages), but the guy at the triage refused to talk to me because """"I don't have a referral"""", which I understand but all I wanted was some support, so I found this hurtful & rude, & my Psychiatrist agreed, he said they should be helping. ."",suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Feeling like I annoy my Psychiatrist and everybody in general,UID417,""Hi everyone on the forums. Admins/mods, if this isn't an appropriate thread, feel free to move it, I wasn't sure which topic to post it in. Anyway, I've been feeling like I annoy my Psychiatrist, and I feel like I'm such a burden to him. Last time I saw him I told him that I'm sorry for being a burden and he said """"you're not a burden, that's my job"""" in a kind reassuring way with a smile. It helped a little bit hearing that reassurance from him but now I've just been feeling that way more. I see my Psychiatrist on Skype (Telehealth) because we're in different states and through this company that does it (Medicare pay for it). He's never been rude to me but I just feel like, especially lately, that he thinks """"oh I have to see  again, ugh, what rubbish has she got to talk about now?"""" and stuff like that. I know it's his job but I just feel like I'm using up all of his time and I feel like he just has to worry about me and I'm not intending for it to be that way. I've tried to reassure myself but I just can't. I have a good connection with him because he's the only therapist I have since I don't see Psychologists because of bad experiences, and I have a new GP. But it's too long in between appointments (I see him once a month). I'm too scared to ask if I can see him more often because I don't want to sound pushy and demanding and make him uncomfortable, but at the same time I feel like I need to ask for my own sake. I can't get any other support, the triage he referred me to won't even speak to me, I told him this, he said """"that's a ridiculous service then"""". I don't know why I'm feeling this way, he's always been nice and caring towards me. I just feel like I bother and annoy him, even though we also joke about things in my sessions. I don't know what else to say and how else to word it, I'm not in a good head space right now. I definitely want to keep seeing him because he's the only therapist I've ever liked, I don't know if I should tell him that I'm worried that he doesn't like working with me or not. This is me putting myself down, not him. I know it's paranoia and anxiety, and depression too, talking but I can't stop these thoughts. I'm too scared to mention it. I just want to hurt myself because I can't cope with life in general, and lack of support apart from him, professional wise. I don't know what I'm looking for by making this thread, I guess I just needed to vent. I'm sorry all. Sorry this is lengthy too.

"Not really feeling well,UID73,""I am an international university student and have failed some subjects over the past semesters and my parents don't know about it I just hate what I'm studying at the moment and the main reason I'm studying is because my parents forced me to I have tried hinting to them that I just hate this subject but they always tell me to just go through with it and now its too late to change courses because I'm in my third year. I am too scared to tell them and it messes with my head all the time. Recently they asked for my sign in details to my university account and if I give it to them they'll find out. Ever since that day I have been unable to do anything or concentrate on anything my studies or even doing something like playing games and such. I don't even feel like eating as well, the only reason I do eat is that i know I need it to survive. The only thing I know that takes me off things is listening to those relaxing music videos on youtube but they are starting to lose effect as well. I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to explain this feeling but I feel like I am all alone bottled up with emotions I feel scared every day and just feel unhappy for the past few years. I have met with a counselor but it hasn't helped me a whole lot he has given me exercises here and there but it hasn't really helped. I just have no friends to talk to about this and I worried about burdening them with what I'm going through at the moment. All that with all the financial difficulties that I am facing as well with some accumulated debt that I'm facing I just don't know what to do, there's nothing really that I can do due to restrictions. The only thing I know is that sleep helps and when I get up it all just comes back. I always wish I could just sleep forever. Even though I haven't attempted it I have always thought about it thinking it would be the easier way out.

"Can no longer deal with my self-destructive behaviour ,UID95,""I don't want to feel like this anymore. I've had so many lies kept up in the air and trying to juggle them to make myself feel better - In a world where you feel worthless if you haven't done something that makes people think you're successful or attractive. Ultimately I just want to be loved and I know that. i feel as though if I had grown up with the right parents (the right dad) and in the right environment I would be normal, I would have been really great actually. but I feel this is the catch, as much potential as I have, and I know I have, this is matched with something I can no longer run from, this painful self destructive behaviour I've kept from everyone, my mum, my partner and my friends. I've done every bad thing you could possibly do to hurt someone (without breaking the law of course) My behaviour, if it was known... is awful. In the eyes of everyone else I am so lovely but to myself I am honestly disgusting and I don't know what to do anymore."",suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I can't take it anymore (life), please help,UID417,""Hi,  here, & I'm 20. I can't take anything anymore. I have no friends, online or in person, no family either other than my parents. I used to talk to my Auntie who I've only met once since she lives interstate, which is one of my Dad's Sisters. However, on Christmas Day, I told her how suicidal I was. She blocked me. So that really hurt, & I haven't spoken to her any way since of course. Some days I don't let it bother me but some days it hurts. I live in a small country town, about 4,000 or so people. I've done everything & I mean everything I can to get a job, meet people/join groups, volunteer, everything. I'm always told no & discriminated against, I don't know why. I have no skills but I've told everyone I'm more than happy to learn, & fake it & have a positive attitude & have a laugh with everyone. I did go to the local Headspace & the manager & group members just made fun of my mental illnesses, aswell as the Psychologist there, so I made a complaint & the manager lost her job, & I haven't been back there. That's all there is around here. I don't want to see Psychologists anymore because they've treated me terribly & other places similar to Headspace never replied to me so I don't know if they're shut down. & no, there's no employment agencies or anything else for people my age or in their teens, not even in surrounding suburbs. I can't afford to go to TAFE &/or Uni, but I've looked into it. The free courses you need qualifications & had to do a course beforehand & I have none of that. My parents & I have looked into moving a lot, yes, but it's not that easy. & yes they know everything that I deal with, because I don't have anybody else. I spend my days at home or going out with my parents, & going for walks. So in other words I have no life. Nothing to live for really. I have a Psychiatrist who I see on Skype & he's great, but my GP is terrible & I feel like she's trying to stop me from seeing my Psychiatrist. She has no knowledge of anything & treats me terribly, & I've been looking into getting another GP. I have a referral for the local triage but my parents, GP & I said I shouldn't go there because it's a scary place. I have no other options. I talk to BB, Lifeline & all of those when I can.

The only people who actually care are my kids and they are too young to know what's going on. I have depression and anxiety and am seeing a psychologist and have had medication adjusted by my GP but this time it's just not helping. The past 2 months have been extremely hard and sometimes I'm taking it minute by minute, hour by hour just to get through. I just want to disappear but can't because my kids need me and that makes it even worse as I'm stuck here feeling like this and can't do anything to make the feelings go away.
